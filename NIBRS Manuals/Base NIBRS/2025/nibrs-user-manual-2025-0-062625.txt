1 Introduction
The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program is a nationwide, cooperative statistical effort
of more than 19,000 federal, state, county, city, university and college, and tribal law
enforcement agencies (LEAs) voluntarily reporting data on offenses reported or known. Since
1930, the FBI has administered the UCR Program and continues to assess and monitor the
nature and type of crime in the nation. The program’s primary objective is to generate reliable
information for use in law enforcement (LE) administration, operation, and management.
However, over the years, UCR data have become one of the country’s leading social indicators.
Criminologists, sociologists, legislators, municipal planners, the media, and other students of
criminal justice use the data for varied research and planning purposes.
The FBI’s UCR Program prepared this manual to assist LEAs in reporting their crime statistics via
the Program’s National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). The manual addresses NIBRS
policies, the types of offenses reported via NIBRS, and guidelines for an agency to become
certified to submit NIBRS data to the FBI.
1.1 Background of NIBRS
Originally, the FBI’s UCR Program was designed as a summary system to collect only the most
serious offense within an incident. However, the Program began using incident-based reporting
(i.e., NIBRS) in 1989 to capture all offenses within an incident—up to ten crime occurrences.
Through NIBRS, LEAs report data on each offense and arrest within 28 offense categories made
up of 71 specific crimes called Group A offenses. For each of the Group A offenses coming to
their attention, the LE collects administrative, offense, property, victim, offender, and arrestee
information. LEAs report only arrest data for an additional 10 Group B offense categories.
By design, LEAs generate NIBRS data as a by-product of their respective records management
systems (RMSs). Therefore, an LEA builds its system to suit its own individual needs, including
all of the information required for administration and operation, then forwards only the data
required by NIBRS to the FBI’s UCR Program. As more agencies report via NIBRS, the data
collected will provide a clearer assessment of the nation’s crime experience.
1.2 UCR Advisory Groups
In the 1920s, the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) developed a system to
collect uniform crime statistics that became the foundation of the UCR Program in 1929. The
IACP, along with the National Sheriffs’ Association (NSA), continues to provide vital links
between local LE and the FBI in the administration of the UCR Program through their Criminal
Justice Information Services (CJIS) Committees. The IACP represents thousands of police
departments nationwide, and the NSA encourages sheriffs throughout the country to
participate fully in the program.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 1
Both the IACP and the NSA’s committees are involved with the Advisory Policy Board (APB) of
the FBI’s CJIS Division. The CJIS APB is the formal advisory process for the FBI’s UCR Program.
The APB began in 1988 when a Data Providers’ APB was established. The Board operated until
1993 when it combined with the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) CJIS APB to form a
single APB to address all FBI criminal justice information services. The underlying philosophy of
the APB is one of shared management. The FBI, along with state and local data providers and
system users, share responsibility for the operation and management of all systems
administered by the FBI for the benefit of the criminal justice community. The current APB
includes the UCR Subcommittee, which reviews issues concerning NIBRS, the Law Enforcement
Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA), and the Hate Crime Data Collections. The APB also
includes additional subcommittees that review other matters involving the FBI’s CJIS Division.
In addition to the IACP, NSA, and APB, the Association of State UCR Programs (ASUCRP) also
serves to link the FBI with LEAs that submit and use UCR data. ASUCRP focuses on improving
the collection, use, and utility of crime data reported to the FBI’s UCR Program. The state UCR
organizations foster widespread, responsible use of crime statistics and lend assistance to data
contributors when needed.
1.3 UCR Program Standards
More than 19,000 LEAs are eligible to provide data to the FBI’s UCR Program. To streamline the
collection of UCR data, ensure the consistency and comparability of data, and provide a higher
quality of service, states have a state UCR Program collecting data for the state’s LEAs and
reporting it to the FBI’s UCR Program. Establishment of a UCR Program is not limited to state
governments. Federal, territorial, and tribal agencies may also institute UCR Programs. UCR
Programs gather crime information from the LEAs under their domain and forward the data to
the FBI.
The following are the standards under which a UCR Program must operate:
1. A UCR Program must conform to the FBI’s UCR Program submission standards,
definitions, specifications, and required deadlines.
2. A UCR Program must establish data integrity procedures and have personnel assigned to
assist contributing agencies in quality assurance practices and crime reporting
procedures.
3. A UCR Program’s submissions must cover more than 50 percent of the LEAs within its
established reporting domain and be willing to cover any and all UCR-contributing
agencies that wish to use the UCR Program from within its domain. (An agency that
wants to become a UCR Program must be willing to report for all the agencies within the
state.)
4. A UCR Program must furnish the FBI’s UCR Program with all of the UCR data collected by
the LEAs within its domain.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 2
These standards do not prohibit a state from gathering other statistical data beyond the
national collection. Data integrity procedures should include crime trend assessments, offense
classification verification, and technical specification validation.
The FBI fulfills its responsibilities in connection with the UCR Programs by:
• Editing and reviewing submissions for completeness and quality.
• Contacting contributors, when necessary, in connection with crime reporting matters.
• Requesting individual agency information, when necessary, from the contributing UCR
Program.
• Assessing the validity of reported data by providing a Quality Assurance Review (QAR).
• Coordinating with the contributing UCR Program to conduct training on LE record-keeping
and crime-reporting procedures.
• Sending UCR Program Quarterly documents that clarify policies and procedures set forth by
the program as well as publication updates and notifications to state programs for
distribution to contributing agencies.
The FBI’s UCR Program refers to LEAs that submit data directly to the FBI without submitting it
first to a state UCR Program as direct contributors because they submit their data directly to
the FBI. The FBI allows individual LEAs to contribute data directly to the UCR Program on a case-
by-case basis and, where applicable, with the state UCR Program’s permission. Direct
contributors work closely with staff from the FBI’s UCR Program to ensure their data adhere to
the FBI’s UCR Program guidelines.
Should circumstances develop whereby a state or other UCR Program does not comply with
these standards, the FBI may reinstitute a direct collection of data submissions from LEAs
within the FBI’s UCR Program domain.
1.4 Jurisdiction
The purpose of establishing appropriate jurisdiction is to depict the nature and amount of crime
in a particular community. Throughout the United States, there are thousands of LEAs; some
have overlapping jurisdictions. To ensure LEAs with overlapping jurisdictions are not reporting
duplicate data (offense or arrest), the FBI’s UCR Program developed the following guidelines:
1. Federal, state, county, city, university and college, and tribal LEAs should report offenses
that occur within their jurisdictions.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 3
2. When two or more federal, state, county, city, university and college, or tribal LEAs are
involved in the investigation of the same offense, the agency with investigative jurisdiction
based on federal, state, local, and tribal law and/or applicable interagency agreements or
memorandums of understanding should report the offense. If there is uncertainty as to the
lead or primary agency, the agencies must agree on which agency should report the
offense. If an incident involves a federal or tribal only offense and a city, university or
college, county, or state LEA is involved, the federal or tribal agency will report the
federal/tribal only offense (denoted with *); and the local agency will report as previously
directed.
3. LEAs will report only those arrests made for offenses committed within their own
jurisdictions.
4. The recovery of property should be reported only by the LEA that first reported it missing
and/or stolen, regardless of which agency recovered it.
As a rule, cities with their own police departments report their own crime data. However,
smaller locales may combine their crime data with larger agencies (e.g., sheriffs’ offices and
state police) for reporting purposes. This practice most often occurs in rural or unincorporated
areas employing constables, town marshals, or other officers who infrequently report offenses.
In cases where the county sheriff or state police has a contract to provide LE services for an
incorporated city, the sheriff or state police will continue to report incidents occurring within
the boundaries of these cities. These reports should reflect the geographic location of where
the incident occurred by use of the city’s Originating Agency Identifier (ORI). In some localities,
a federal LEA, the sheriff, or state police will assist a local police department in the investigation
of crimes committed within the limits of the city. Even though this is the case, the city police
department should report the offenses unless there is a written or oral agreement specifying
otherwise.
1.5 Referrals from Other Agencies
If a reporting agency refers the investigation of an incident to another federal, state, local, or
tribal agency after submitting the data to the FBI’s UCR Program, the original reporting agency
must delete its report. The agency receiving the referral would then report the incident as if it
were an original submission.
2 Incidents and Offenses
Participation in NIBRS requires LEAs to report certain facts about each criminal incident coming
to their attention within their jurisdictions. In most cases, officers capture the data through an
incident report when a complainant first reports the crime. Officers may collect incident data
via a paper form or electronically via a mobile terminal that interfaces with their department’s
RMS.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 4
2.1 Definition of an Incident
For NIBRS, the FBI’s UCR Program defines an incident as one or more offenses committed by
the same offender, or group of offenders acting in concert, at the same time and place.
The Concept of Acting in Concert
Acting in Concert requires all the offenders to actually commit or assist in the commission of all
of the crimes in an incident. The offenders must be aware of, and consent to, the commission
of all the offenses; or even if nonconsenting, their actions assist in the commission of all the
offenses. See Example 1, Acting in Concert. This is important because NIBRS considers all of the
offenders in an incident to have committed all of the offenses in an incident. The arrest of any
offender will clear all of the offenses in the incident. If one or more of the offenders did not act
in concert, then the LEA should report more than one incident. See Examples 2 and 3, Acting in
Concert.
The Concept of Same Time and Place
The fundamental concept of Same Time and Place presupposes that if the same person or
group of persons committed more than one crime and the time and space intervals separating
them were insignificant, all the crimes make up a single incident. Normally, the offenses must
have occurred during an unbroken time period and at the same or adjoining locations.
However, incidents can also be comprised of offenses which, by their nature, involve continuing
criminal activity by the same offenders at different times and places if, LE deems the activity to
constitute a single criminal transaction. See Example 4, Same Time and Place.
In Summary Reporting System (SRS), SRS collect aggregate counts of the number of occurrences
of Part I offense as well as arrest data for both Part I offense and Part II offense in monthly
summary reports. LEAs used the concept of Same Time and Place to determine whether they
should apply the Hierarchy Rule to a group of crimes. The agency reported only the crime
highest in the hierarchy. Though NIBRS does not follow the Hierarchy Rule, LEAs must still apply
the concept of Same Time and Place to determine whether a group of crimes constitutes a
single incident. This is crucially important since the application of the concept determines
whether LEAs should report the crimes as individual incidents or as a single incident comprised
of multiple offenses.
Examples of Acting in Concert and Same Time and Place
It is impossible to provide instructions to cover all situations. However, some examples are
provided below.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 5
Example 1, Acting in Concert
During a robbery in a bar, one offender began to rape a victim. The other offender told the
rapist to stop and only rob the victim. In this example, there was only one incident with two
offenses (Robbery and Rape). Although the other robber did not consent to the Rape, by
displaying a gun he prevented someone from coming to the victim’s assistance and thereby
assisted in the commission of the crime. The LEA should report one incident with two offenses.
Both offenders are connected to the victim through the offense of Robbery and Rape.
Example 2, Acting in Concert
A domestic argument escalated from a shouting match between a husband and wife to an
aggravated assault during which the husband began beating his wife. The wife, in her own
defense, shot and killed her husband. The responding officer submitted one incident report.
The LEA should have reported this information via NIBRS as two separate incidents because the
husband could not have been acting in concert with the wife in his own killing. The LEA would
submit one incident involving the aggravated assault perpetrated by the husband and a second
incident involving the killing. This would allow the maintenance of the original incident number
for record keeping purposes at the local level and simultaneously satisfy reporting
requirements for NIBRS.
Example 3, Acting in Concert
Two offenders robbed a bar, forcing the bartender to surrender money from the cash register
at gunpoint. The robbers also took money and jewelry from three customers. One of the
robbers, in searching for more customers to rob, found a female customer in the rest room and
raped her there without the knowledge of the other offender. When the rapist returned, both
robbers left. In this example, there were two incidents: one involving Robbery and the other
involving Rape, because the offenders were not acting in concert in both offenses. The LEA
should report two incidents, each with one offense.
Example 4, Same Time and Place
Over a period of 18 months, a computer programmer working for a bank manipulated the
bank’s computer and systematically embezzled $70,000. The continuing criminal activity
against the same victim constituted a single incident involving the crime of Embezzlement.
2.2 Classifying Offenses
For NIBRS, LEAs must report all Group A offenses, up to ten, within a particular incident. For
example, an incident can include the crimes of Rape, Motor Vehicle Theft, and
Kidnapping/Abduction. LEAs must ensure that each offense is reported as a separate, distinct
crime and not just a part of another offense. For example, every Robbery includes some type of
assault, but because the assault is an element integral to the crime of Robbery, the LEA should
report only Robbery. However, if during a Robbery, the offender forces the victim to engage in
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 6
sexual relations, then the LEA should report both Robbery and Rape, since forced sexual
intercourse is not an element of the crime of Robbery.
Note: The Robbery/assault example above contains “lesser included” offenses. Lesser included
offenses are offenses where one offense is an element of another offense and cannot be
reported as having happened to the victim along with the other offense. Mutually exclusive
offenses are offenses that cannot occur to the same victim according to UCR Definitions. See
the list of Offense Definitions in Section 2.4 for details. For example, a Murder and an
Aggravated Assault cannot occur to the same victim. (For more information about mutually
exclusive/lesser included offenses, refer to the NIBRS Technical Specification, Data Element 24
[Victim Connected to UCR Offense Code]).
Note: LE should classify and report offenses after they complete the preliminary investigation
of a call for service or a complaint. Since identifying the crime problems faced by LE is one of
the objectives of NIBRS, agencies should report only offenses known to LE, not the findings of a
court, coroner, jury, or prosecutor.
Criteria for Distinguishing Between Group A and Group B Offenses
When reporting data to the FBI’s UCR Program via NIBRS, LEAs must also classify the offenses
within an incident as Group A offenses or Group B offenses. Though some state and local RMSs
require the same level of reporting for all offenses, NIBRS requires differing levels of detail in
reporting Group A and Group B offenses. LEAs must report both incidents and arrests for Group
A offenses, and they must report only arrests for Group B offenses. The Group A offenses are
the more serious crimes such as Murder, Rape, Robbery, etc. Group B offenses tend to be
minor in nature, such as Curfew/Loitering/Vagrancy Violations, Disorderly Conduct, Driving
Under the Influence, etc. See the listing of Group A and Group B offenses in Section 2.3 Group A
and Group B offense listing.
NIBRS contributors should use the following criteria to determine if a crime should be
designated as a Group A offense:
• The seriousness or significance of the offense.
• The frequency or volume of its occurrence.
• The prevalence of the offense nationwide.
• The probability LE becomes aware of the offense.
• The likelihood LE is the best channel for collecting data regarding the offense.
• The burden placed on LE in collecting data on the offense.
• The national statistical validity and usefulness of the data collected.
• The FBI’s UCR Program responsibility to make crime data available not only to LE but to
others having a legitimate interest in it.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 7
Additional Information Regarding Classifying Offenses
The UCR Program does not collect information on traffic offenses (e.g., parking and moving
violations) except for Driving Under the Influence, Hit and Run (of a person), and Vehicular
Manslaughter.
Unless it is a component of a Group A offense (e.g., Human Trafficking) when an offense
includes one of the Offenses of General Applicability (i.e., words, phrases, or a similar variation
thereof), LEAs should report the offense as the Group B offense 90Z—All Other Offenses if the
substantive offense is a Group A offense. If it involves a Group B offense, LEAs should report the
offense in the appropriate Group B category. The Offenses of General Applicability are
Accessory Before/After the Fact, Aiding/Abetting, Conspiracy to Commit, Enticement,
Facilitation of, Solicitation to Commit, Threat to Commit.
LEAs should report attempted crimes the same as the substantive offense, with the data value
A = Attempted in Data Element 7 (Offense Attempted/Completed/Unfounded). Agencies should
report attempted murders as Aggravated Assaults, and all assaults should be reported as
C = Completed. Agencies should report U = Unfounded when a previously reported offense was
determined not to be a crime. (Data elements are data fields within each segment of the Group
A Incident Report and in the Group B Arrest Report to describe the details of each component
of a crime; a data value is a specific characteristic or type of field being reported that has an
assigned code, e.g., M = Male or F = Female).
Example 1
An LEA arrested three members of a motorcycle gang for conspiracy to commit Murder. The
LEA should submit three Group B Arrest Reports with the UCR Arrest Offense Code entered as
90Z = All Other Offenses.
Example 2
An LEA arrested five liquor store owners for conspiring to avoid paying local liquor taxes. The
LEA should submit five Group B Arrest Reports with the UCR Arrest Offense Code entered as
90G = Liquor Law Violations.
Example 3
A witness observed and scared away two unknown teenagers who were trying to set fire to an
abandoned building. The LEA should submit a Group A Incident Report that indicated the UCR
Offense Code as 200 = Arson and the offense was Attempted.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 8
Offense Categories – Crimes Against Persons, Property, and Society
Each NIBRS offense belongs in one of three categories: Crimes Against Persons, Crimes Against
Property, and Crimes Against Society. Crimes Against Persons, e.g., Murder, Rape, and Assault,
are those offenses whose victims are always individuals. The object of Crimes Against Property,
e.g., Robbery, Bribery, and Burglary, is to obtain money, property, or some other benefit.
Crimes Against Society, e.g., Animal Cruelty, Drug Violations, Gambling, and Prostitution,
represent society’s prohibition against engaging in certain types of activity.
For counting purposes, agencies should count one offense for each victim of a Crime Against
Person, one offense for each distinct operation of a Crime Against Property (except for Motor
Vehicle Theft, where one offense is counted for each stolen vehicle), and one offense for each
Crime Against Society.
The listings of the Group A and Group B offenses appearing in this section indicate whether the
offenses are Crimes Against Persons, Property, or Society.
The Use of Offense Codes in NIBRS
In NIBRS, there are 81 three-digit UCR offense codes; one for each of the 71 Group A and 10
Group B offenses. The three-digit data values are used to identify the Group A and Group B
offenses in an incident to submit NIBRS Group A Incident Reports and Group B Arrest Reports.
Group A Offense Codes
There are 28 Group A crime categories made up of 71 Group A offenses; therefore, there are 71
Group A Offense Codes. The Group A Offense Codes, while unique to NIBRS, were generally
derived from the four-digit NCIC Uniform Offense Classification Codes to facilitate interrelating
offense data between the NCIC and the FBI’s UCR Program. NIBRS correlates these data using
the first two characters from the NCIC codes of certain offenses as the same first two
characters of the UCR Offense Codes for respective offenses. The third character of the NIBRS
Offense Code is designated as either a zero (0) or an alphabetic character (A, B, C, etc.) to
reference a subcategory of the crime category. For example, the NCIC code for Simple Assault is
1313, and the NIBRS Offense Code is 13B, e.g., 13B = Simple Assault.
Exceptions to the coding convention of Group A offenses are:
1. The NCIC Offense Code for Statutory Rape is 1116, but the NIBRS Offense Code is
36B = Statutory Rape.
2. The NCIC Offense Code for Criminal Sexual Contact (of child) is 3601, but the NIBRS Offense
Code is 11D = Criminal Sexual Contact.
3. The NCIC Offense Code and NIBRS Offense Code for Espionage* is 103, Treason* is 101.
4. The NIBRS Offense Code for Violation of National Firearm Act of 1934* is 521; there is no
NCIC Offense Code.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 9
5. The NIBRS Offense Code for Weapons of Mass Destruction* is 522; there is no NCIC Offense
Code.
6. The NCIC Offense Code for Explosives* is 5204-5206; 5211, but the NIBRS Offense Code is
526 Explosives*.
(Offenses with and asterisk are only for federal/tribal reporting)
Group B Offense Codes
NIBRS assigned a separate numbering series to the 10 Group B crime categories consisting of 10
Group B offenses. The numbering series used 90 for the first two characters of each Group B
offense and designated an alpha character for the third position.
2.3 Group A and Group B Offense Listing
There are 28 Group A offense categories made up of 71 Group A offenses. The offense
categories are listed below in alphabetical order. Additionally, each offense’s corresponding
NIBRS Offense Code follows its name. Immediately following the code for each offense name is
an indication of whether it is a Crime Against Person, Crime Against Property, or Crime Against

2.4 Offense Definitions
Source of Offense Definitions
The use of standardized definitions in NIBRS is essential to the maintenance of uniform and
consistent data. This practice ensures the FBI’s UCR Program considers and appropriately
counts all criminal offenses of law, regardless of their different titles under state and local law
or United States titles and statutes.
The purpose of the FBI’s UCR Program is to provide a common language transcending the
varying local and state laws. Therefore, the Program did not intend for LEAs to use NIBRS
offense definitions for charging persons with crimes. Instead, LEAs should use the definitions to
translate crime into the common UCR language used throughout the United States. Though
state statutes specifically define crimes so persons facing prosecution will know the exact
charges placed against them, the definitions used in NIBRS must be generic to not exclude
varying state statutes relating to the same type of crime.
The Program based NIBRS offense definitions on the common-law definitions found in Black’s
Law Dictionary, as well as those used in the NCIC 2000 Uniform Offense Classifications. Due to
most states basing their statutes on the common-law definitions, even though they may vary as
to specifics, these definitions should fit into the corresponding NIBRS offense classifications.
State Offenses
If a state statute for an offense includes additional offenses not fitting the NIBRS offense
definition, the LEA should report the nonconforming offenses according to its NIBRS offense
classifications. For example, some states worded their larceny statutes so broadly as to include
the crime of Embezzlement. If an offender perpetrates Embezzlement within such a state, LE
should report the offense via NIBRS as Embezzlement, not Larceny/Theft.
Certainly, unusual situations will arise in classifying offenses, and this manual cannot cover all
circumstances. In classifying unusual situations, LE should consider the nature of the crime
along with the guidelines provided. In addition to the Group A and Group B offense definitions
and explanations, the Offense Lookup Table at the end of this section will also aid in classifying
offenses. If LEAs have concerns on how to classify an offense they can contact the FBI’s UCR
Program Office.
Group A Offenses
There are 28 Group A offense categories made up of 71 Group A offenses. The offense
categories listed below are in alphabetical order. Most entries include the following
information:
• NIBRS offense code, offense name
• Definition

720 Animal Cruelty
The completion of or attempt to intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly take an action that
mistreats or kills any animal without just cause.
Animal Cruelty includes torturing, tormenting, mutilation, maiming, poisoning, or abandonment
of an animal. Included are instances of duty to provide care, e.g., shelter, food, water, care if
sick or injured; transporting or confining an animal likely to cause injury or death, causing an
animal to fight with another; inflicting excessive or repeated unnecessary pain or suffering, e.g.,
uses objects to beat or injure an animal. This offense does not include proper maintenance of
animals for show or sport; use of animals for food, lawful hunting, fishing or trapping.
For Animal Cruelty offenses, reporting agencies must enter at least one but no more than three
types of activity (simple/gross neglect, organized abuse, intentional abuse or torture, or animal
sexual abuse) in Data Element 12 (Type Criminal Activity/Gang Information).

A dog fighting ring is raided during a dog fight. The owner and patrons are arrested. Large
amounts of money and betting slips are seized.
• The agency would report 720 Animal Cruelty, 39A Betting/Wagering, 39B
Operating/Promoting/Assisting Gambling, and 39C Gambling Equipment Violations
offenses.
• The agency would report F = Organized Abuse (Dog Fighting and Cock Fighting) and O =
Operating/Promoting/Assisting Gambling in Data Element 12 (Type of Criminal
Activity/Gang Information). LEAs may enter up to three types of activity for each
offense.
• The agency would report S = Society in Data Element 25 (Type of Victim).
• The agency would report 6 = Seized in Data Element 14 (Type Property Loss/Etc.) with
property descriptions of 14 = Gambling Equipment and 20 = Money in Data Element 15
(Property Description).
A law enforcement officer pulls over a man who is wanted for robbery. The man flees on foot.
The law enforcement officer releases his K-9 to apprehend the man. After a brief struggle, the
man stabs the K-9.
• The agency would report a 720 Animal Cruelty offense.
• Although the K-9 is considered a law enforcement partner, this offense should not be
classified as a 13A Aggravated Assault since the definition of an aggravated assault is
defined as “An unlawful attack by one person upon another”.
• Since 720 Animal Cruelty is a Crime Against Society, the victim would be S =
Society/Public in Data Element 25 (Type of Victim).

200 Arson
To unlawfully and intentionally damage or attempt to damage any real property or personal
property by fire or incendiary device.
An LEA should report only fires determined through investigation to have been unlawfully and
intentionally set. Though the agency should include attempts to burn, it should not include fires
of suspicious or unknown origin. In addition, an agency should report one incident for each
distinct Arson operation originating within its jurisdiction. If a fire originated by Arson in one
jurisdiction spreads to another jurisdiction and destroys property, the LEA in which the fire
originated should report the incident and all dollar value damage. The key to proper arson
classifications is the establishment of the point of origin of the fire.
If a fire marshal collects Arson-related incident information, the LEA having jurisdiction should
gather the information from the fire marshal and report it with their monthly submission
(unless the Fire Marshall has a valid UCR ORI). The FBI’s UCR Program excludes Arson-related
deaths and injuries of police officers and firefighters, unless determined as willful Murders or
assaults, due to the hazardous nature of these professions.
LEAs should report the type of property burned into Data Element 15 (Property Description)
and the value of property burned in Data Element 16 (Value of Property), which includes
incidental damage resulting from fighting the fire. Structures deemed abandoned but arson-
related would be collected within this category.
Scenario:
Two boys unlawfully and intentionally set a shed on fire in Jurisdiction A. The blaze spreads
across several acres and crosses over to Jurisdiction B.
• Jurisdiction A agency reports the completed 200 Arson offense due to investigation
determining Jurisdiction A was the point of origin for the Arson.
• Jurisdiction A agency reports all damage which occurred in both Jurisdiction A and B in
Data Element 16 (Value of Property) with a property type loss of 2 = Burned in Data
Element 14 (Type Property Loss). Jurisdiction A agency reports all property which was
burned in Jurisdiction A and B in Data Element 15 (Description of Property).
• Jurisdiction A will not report a 290 Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property offense
even if the damage is deemed substantial. For Arson, agencies should include the
damage resulting from the fire as part of the loss caused by burning and extinguishing
the fire.
13A – 13C Assault Offenses
An unlawful attack by one person upon another.
Careful consideration of the following factors should assist in classifying assaults:
1. The type of weapon employed or the use of an object as a weapon.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 17
2. The seriousness of the injury.
3. The intent and capability of the assailant to cause serious injury.
The weapons used or the extent of the injury sustained typically will be the deciding factors in
distinguishing Aggravated from Simple Assault. A weapon can be a gun, knife or anything that
could be used to harm someone else (a broken glass bottle, rocks, a shoe, etc.) In only a very
limited number of instances should it be necessary to examine the intent and capability of the
assailant. The prosecution policies in a jurisdiction should not influence classification or
reporting of LE offense data. Reporting agencies should examine and classify the assaults in
their respective jurisdictions according to the standard UCR definitions, regardless of whether
the offenses are termed misdemeanors or felonies by local definitions.
By definition there can be no attempted assaults, only completed assaults. Therefore, reporting
agencies must enter the data value of C = Completed for all Assault Offenses into Data Element 7
(Offense Attempted/Completed/Unfounded). Agencies should report U = Unfounded when a
previously reported offense was determined not to be a crime.
13A Aggravated Assault
An unlawful attack by one person upon another wherein the offender uses a dangerous
weapon or displays it in a threatening manner or the victim suffers obvious severe or
aggravated bodily injury, or where there was a risk for serious injury/intent to seriously
injure.
Apparent broken bones, loss of teeth, possible internal injury, severe laceration, or loss of
consciousness.
Strangulation (choking) may be difficult to determine; however, common signs include loss of
consciousness/blacking out; petechiae (small broken blood vessels) of the eyes, earlobes, or
scalp; bruising/marks on the neck; respiratory distress; nausea/vomiting; light headedness; or
involuntary urination and/or defecation.
Note: NIBRS considers Mace®and pepper spray to be weapons. A severe laceration is one that
should receive medical attention. A loss of consciousness must be the direct result of force
inflicted on the victim by the offender.
Scenario:
A woman swings a baseball bat at her brother during an argument. The man ducks and runs
away. The man sustained no injury.
• The agency would report a 13A Aggravated Assault offense due to the offender using a
weapon that could cause serious bodily injury.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 18
• The agency would report C = Completed in Data Element 7 (Offense
Attempted/Completed/Unfounded) since, by definition, there can be no attempted
assault.
• The agency would report 30 = Blunt Object in Data Element 13 (Type Weapon/Force
Involved). The agency would report N = None in Data Element 33 (Type Injury).
13B Simple Assault
An unlawful physical attack by one person upon another where neither the offender displays
a dangerous weapon, nor the victim suffers obvious severe or aggravated bodily injury
involving apparent broken bones, loss of teeth, possible internal injury, severe laceration, or
loss of consciousness.
Simple assault includes offenses such as minor assault, hazing, assault and battery, and injury
caused by culpable negligence or attempts to do so.
Scenarios:
An offender punched a law enforcement officer while the offender is resisting arrest. The
officer sustained only a bruised cheek.
• The agency would report a 13B Simple Assault offense.
• The agency would report L = Law Enforcement Officer in Data Element 25 (Type of
Victim), since 13B Simple Assault is one of the Crimes Against Persons offenses that
accepts a victim type of L = Law Enforcement Officer.
Since the incident involved a Law Enforcement Officer, the agency would report
o
Data Element 25A (Type of Office Activity/Circumstance), Data Element 25B
(Officer Assignment Type). The Data Element 25C (Officer-ORI Other Jurisdiction)
would only be reported if the officer was from another jurisdiction.
The agency would report 01 = Attempting Other Arrests in Data Element 25A
o
(Type of Office Activity/Circumstance).
• The agency would report M = Apparent Minor Injury in Data Element 33 (Type Injury).
A woman became angry at her boyfriend and swung her fist to hit him in the jaw. The man
backed away from her before she came into contact with him. The man was able to leave the
house before anything additional occurred.
• The agency would report a 13B Simple Assault offense as this is an unlawful physical
attack by one person upon another.
• The agency would report C = Completed in Data Element 7 (Offense
Attempted/Completed/Unfounded) since, by definition, there can be no attempted
assaults.
• The agency would report 40 = Personal Weapons (hands, fist, feet, arms, teeth, etc.) in
Data Element 13 (Type Weapon/Force Involved). The agency would report N = None in
Data Element 33 (Type Injury).
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 19
13C Intimidation
To unlawfully place another person in reasonable fear of harm through the use of threatening
words and/or other conduct without displaying a dangerous weapon or subjecting the victim
to an actual physical attack.
This offense includes stalking. In addition, the offender can make threats in person, over the
telephone, in writing, through electronic communications, etc.
Scenarios:
A threat is made online to a local business. A concerned citizen contacted LE to report the
threat.
• The agency would report a 13C Intimidation offense.
• The agency would report I = Individual in Data Element 25 (Type of Victim) since 13C
Intimidation is a Crimes Against Persons offense. The agency may choose to list the
victim’s information as concerned citizen’s information or the manager of the business’s
information, or anyone else who may have been in fear of harm.
A school secretary answers the phone, and the caller threatens there is a bomb in the school.
The secretary notifies law enforcement.
• The agency would report a 13C Intimidation offense.
• The agency would report I = Individual in Data Element 25 (Type of Victim) since
13C Intimidation is a Crimes Against Persons offense, which accepts victim types of I =
Individual or L = Law Enforcement Officer. The agency may choose to list the victim’s
information as school’s secretary information, the school’s principal’s information, or
anyone else who may have been put in fear of harm.
510 Bribery
The completed or attempted offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting anything of value (e.g., a
bribe, gratuity, or kickback) to sway the judgement or action of a person in a position of trust
or influence.
In addition to bribes, gratuities, and kickbacks, the phrase, “anything of value,” includes favors
or anything else used illegally to influence the outcome of something governed by law, fair play,
contractual agreement, or any other guideline. The offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting of the
bribe would bring the outcome of an event outside any realm of reasonableness, the result of
which could be predicted based on the offering or influence given to the person(s) in a position
to render decisions.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 20
Note: This offense excludes sports bribery (i.e., changing the outcome of a sporting contest
or event). Agencies should report such activities under the crime category of gambling
offenses as 39D Sports Tampering, not Bribery.
Scenario:
A city mayor accepts kickbacks from a construction company CEO in exchange for supporting
a multimillion dollar no-bid contract. The mayor received cash payments and hundreds of
thousands of dollars in home remodeling from the CEO due to agreeing to award the city’s
contract to the CEO’s construction company.
• The agency would report a 510 Bribery offense.
• The agency would report two offenders to include the mayor for receiving the bribe and
the CEO for giving the bribe.
220 Burglary/Breaking & Entering
The unlawful entry or attempted entry into a building or some other structure to commit a
felony or a theft.
By definition, a structure has four walls, a roof, and a door (e.g., apartment, barn, cabin, church,
condominium, dwelling house, factory, garage, house trailer or houseboat if used as a
permanent dwelling, mill, office, outbuilding, public building, railroad car, room, school,
screened in porch, stable, vessel or ship, warehouse).
A structure is also any house trailer or other mobile unit permanently fixed as an office,
residence, or storehouse. However, a tent, tent trailer, motor-home, house trailer, or any other
mobile unit used for recreational purposes is not a structure. LEAs should not classify the illegal
entry of such mobile units, followed by a felony, theft, or attempt to commit a felony or theft,
as burglary, but rather as larceny.
Larceny/Theft is an element of Burglary, agencies should not report the Larceny as a separate
offense if it is associated with the unlawful entry of a structure. The element of trespass is
essential to the offense of 220 Burglary/Breaking and Entering.
Hotel Rule
The Hotel Rule applies to burglaries of hotels, motels, lodging houses, or other places where
lodging of transients is the main purpose. In addition, temporary rental storage facilities are
covered by the Hotel Rule.
• If a number of units under a single manager are the object of a Burglary and the
manager, rather than the individual tenants/renters, will most likely report the offenses
to the police, the agency should report the Burglary to the FBI’s UCR Program as a single
incident. Examples are burglaries of multiple rental hotel rooms, rooms in “flop” houses,
rooms in a youth hostel, and units in a motel.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 21
• If multiple occupants rent or lease individual living or working areas in a building for a
period of time, which would preclude the tenancy from being classified as transient, and
the occupants would most likely report the individual burglaries separately, the
reporting agency should submit the burglaries as separate incidents. Examples of this
latter type of multiple burglaries include burglaries of multiple apartments in an
apartment house, offices of a number of commercial firms in a business building, offices
of separate professionals within one building, and rooms in a college dormitory.
When a hotel, motel, inn, other temporary lodging, or a rental storage facility is the location of
a Burglary, the LEA additionally reports the number of premises (e.g., rooms, suites, units, or
storage compartments) in Data Element 10 (Number of Premises Entered). For all Burglary
offenses, the agency reports the method of entry in Data Element 11 (Method of Entry) as
either data value F = Force or N = No Force. A forced entry occurs when the offender(s) uses
force of any degree or a mechanical contrivance of any kind (e.g., a passkey or skeleton key) to
unlawfully enter a building or other structure. An unforced entry occurs when the offender(s)
achieves unlawful entry without force through an unlocked door or window. If both forced and
unforced entries are involved, the agency should enter F = Force.
Agencies should report 290 Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property resulting from a
Burglary (e.g., a forced door, broken window, or hole in the wall) when deemed substantial by
the reporting agency. If deemed substantial, the agency should report the damage under the
offense category 290 Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property.
Note: LEAs classify offenses according to NIBRS definitions and not according to federal, state,
or local codes. For example, though some jurisdictions may categorize a 23C Shoplifting or a
23F Theft From a Motor Vehicle as 220 Burglary/Breaking & Entering, the FBI’s UCR Program
considers these offenses as Larcenies. Thefts from a Motor Vehicle (whether locked or
unlocked); Shoplifting from commercial establishments; and Thefts from Coin Boxes, or Coin-
Operated Machines (including machines that accept paper bills and/or credit/debit cards) do
not involve unlawful entry of a structure; thus, no Burglary occurred.
Scenarios:
Three boys unlawfully enter a jewelry store after hours by entering through an unlocked
window in the back of the building. They smash the jewelry cases and turn over a shelving
unit causing over $3,000 in damage. The boys steal several pieces of jewelry.
• The agency would report a 220 Burglary/Breaking & Entering offense for the unlawful
entry into a building to commit a theft.
• For the 220 Burglary/Breaking & Entering offense, the agency would report data values
for N = No Force in Data Element 11 (Method of Entry) and 7 = Stolen in Data Element
14 (Type Property Loss/Etc.).
• The agency would also report a 290 Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property due to
substantial damages exceed $249 in value. Agencies should report
destruction/damage/vandalism of property resulting from a Burglary (e.g., forced door,
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 22
broken window, or hole in the wall, or dynamited safe) only if the amount of damage is
deemed substantial.
A woman is caught shoplifting at a clothing store and is arrested. While speaking with the
manager, the law enforcement officer learns the woman had been previously banned from
the premises for similar incidents.
• The agency would report a 220 Burglary/Breaking & Entering offense.
• Although the offender was unlawfully taking merchandise exposed for sale, the agency
would not report a 23C Shoplifting offense because the offender had been previously
trespassed (banned) from the building. This qualifies as an unlawful entry into a
structure to commit a theft.
58A-61B, 620 Commerce Violations
58A Import Violations*
To knowingly or willfully defraud the United States by smuggling, importing, or clandestinely
introducing merchandise that should have been invoiced, received, bought, sold, or facilitate
the transportation, the concealment, or sale of such merchandise after importation.
Note: Only federal and tribal LEAs may report 58A Import Violations.
Scenario:
A man who sells reptiles at a small pet shop decides to surreptitiously strap two geckos, two
monitor lizards, and 11 skinks to his body and board a flight from Australia to Los Angeles. He
does not attempt to obtain a permit to import these animals and he does not declare that he
is carrying the animals to U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officers while making entry
into the United States.
• The agency would report a 58A Import Violation offense for smuggling merchandise into
the United States.
Federal law permits the importation of merchandise, including live animals, but
o
all items must be declared to U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officers upon
entry into the United States.
The fact that the man attempted to hide the animals on his person is evidence
o
that he knew they would not be allowed into the United States without a permit.
If he had not been caught at the airport, the transportation to and sale of the
o
animals at his pet store would also constitute a violation of this offense.
58B Export Violations*
To knowingly or willfully defraud or attempt to defraud the United States by smuggling,
exporting, or clandestinely distributing merchandise that should have been invoiced,
received, bought, sold, or facilitate the transportation, the concealment, or sale of such
merchandise after exportation.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 23
Note: Only federal and tribal LEAs may report 58B Export Violations.
Scenario:
A man who owns an import/export company in Tennessee arranges to have multiple motors,
pumps, valves, and other items valued at more than $100,000 transported to Iran from
Savannah, Georgia, in a series of shipments. Due to various trade embargos, most business
transactions with Iran are prohibited. The man falsely identifies the ultimate consignee of the
shipment as a company in Turkey in an effort to avoid these restrictions.
• The agency would report a 58B Export Violation offense for falsely identifying a
company in Turkey, to illegally ship those good to Iran.
Federal law permits the export of most items to foreign countries, but there are
o
restrictions on sending specific items to certain countries.
The fact that the exporter falsely identified a company in Turkey as the ultimate
o
consignee of the shipment is evidence that he knew it was illegal to ship these
goods to Iran.
All good exported from the United States must be declared to U.S. Customs and
o
Border Protection and any attempt to provide false information relating to such
transactions also constitutes a violation of this offense.
61A Federal Liquor Offenses*
The unlawful production (using an unregistered still), transportation (without proper bill of
lading), receipt, distribution, or smuggling of distilled spirits on which federal tax has not
been paid. Acting as a distiller, a winery, or a wholesaler of distilled spirits, wine, or malt
beverages without a federal permit.
It is legal to own any size still for decoration, for distilling water, essential oils, or any other non-
alcoholic product. However, Federal law strictly prohibits individuals from producing any
amount of distilled spirits (alcohol) at home or at any place that is not issued a permit to do so.
In addition, there are no exemptions for the production of distilled spirits for personal or family
use. Under no circumstances should an individual ever distill or sell alcohol without a permit.
An operational still being used to produce alcohol may not be located in a residence or in sheds,
yards, or enclosures connected to a residence. The act of using the still to produce alcohol is
illegal regardless of the quantity of distilled spirits produced.
Furthermore, agencies should report 61A Federal Liquor Offenses when the individual did not
pay the federal tax on the liquor produced. Distribution of non-tax paid liquor, with or without
reimbursement, is illegal. It is legal to produce limited quantities of beer and wine for personal
consumption and sharing.
Federal law permits adults to make up to 100 gallons of homemade beer and/or wine per
calendar year if there is only one adult living in the household, and up to 200 gallons if there are
two or more adults in the household.

Scenarios:
A person is curious about his family’s heritage of distilling “moonshine.” Following designs
found on the internet, the individual constructs a small still in their garage and makes a batch
(any quantity) of distilled spirits using “Grandpa’s Recipe.” The individual shares the distilled
spirits (liquor) with family and friends at no cost to them.
• The agency would report a 61A Federal Liquor Offenses.
Federal law strictly prohibits individuals from producing any amount of distilled
o
spirits (alcohol) at home or at any place that is not issued a permit to do so.
The individual did not (and could not in this scenario) obtain the required federal
o
permit to operate the still to produce alcohol.
A hobbyist decides that she and her spouse will learn how to brew beer and make wine at
home. Following recipes from books at the library they produce three 50-gallon barrels of
beer and two 50-gallon barrels of wine. They share their beers and wines from family and
friends at no cost to them.
• The agency would only report a 61A Federal Liquor Offense if:
The quantity of beer/wine produced exceeds 100 gallons of each product and
o
there is only one resident of the household, or
If the quantity of beer/wine exceeds 200 gallons of each product if there are two
o
residents of the household.
The homemade beer or wine is being sold.
o
61B Federal Tobacco Offenses*
The unlawful possession and/or distribution of contraband tobacco products; including any
quantity of cigarettes in excess of 10,000 or other tobacco products if the cigarettes/products
bear no evidence of the payment of applicable state taxes in the state where the cigarettes

250 Counterfeiting/Forgery
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 26
The altering, copying, or imitating of something, without authority or right, to deceive or
defraud by passing the copy or thing altered or imitated as that which is original or genuine,
or the selling, buying, or possession of an altered, copied, or imitated thing to deceive or
defraud.
Most states treat Counterfeiting and Forgery as allied offenses. This category includes offenses
such as altering and forging public and other records; making, altering, forging or counterfeiting
bills, notes, drafts, tickets, checks, credit cards, etc.; forging wills, deeds, notes, bonds, seals,
trademarks, etc.; counterfeiting coins, plates, banknotes, checks, etc.; possessing forged or
counterfeit instruments; erasures; signing the name of another or fictitious person to defraud;
using forged labels; possession, manufacture, etc., of counterfeiting apparatus; and selling
goods with altered, forged, or counterfeit trademarks. Although Counterfeiting/Forgery
offenses can involve elements of Fraud, the FBI’s UCR Program treats them separately due to
their unique nature.
When incidents involving the passing of a forged or counterfeited instrument to obtain items
occur, an additional Fraud offense should accompany the Counterfeiting/Forgery to allow the
capture of fraudulently obtained items.
Agencies must enter the type of activity (namely publishing, distributing, selling, buying,
possessing, or transporting) in Data Element 12, (Type Criminal Activity/Gang Information).
Likewise, the agency must enter the type of property altered, counterfeited, or forged in Data
Element 15 (Property Description).Questions may arise in scoring Counterfeiting/Forgery
offenses for UCR purposes when LEAs find the offender(s) used forged checks or counterfeit
money to obtain items such as cash, groceries, electronic equipment, etc. If the offense of
Counterfeiting/Forgery is completed, the agency can only enter in Data Element 14 (Type
Property Loss/Etc.) either 3 = Counterfeited/Forged, 5 = Recovered, or 6 = Seized.
An offender is pulled over for displaying a fictitious temporary license plate.
• The agency would report a 250 Counterfeiting/Forgery Offense for possessing a
counterfeit/forged license plate and a 26A False Pretenses/Swindle/Confidence Game
offense for displaying the plate with intent to deceive/defraud.
• For the 250 Counterfeiting/Forgery offense, the agency would report 3 =
Counterfeited/Forged in Data Element 14 (Type Property Loss/Etc.) and 38 = Vehicle
Parts/Accessories in Data Element 15 (Property Description) since the instrument
counterfeited/forged with a license plate.
• For the 26A False Pretenses/Swindle/Confidence Game offense, the agency would
report 7 = Stolen in Data Element 14 (Type Property Loss/Etc.) and 66 = Identity–
Intangible in Data Element 15 (Property Description) and G = Government in Data
Element 25 (Type of Victim) to capture the property that was obtained by displaying the
fictitious plate and identifying the government as the victim of the deceit.

of Victim) to capture the property that was obtained by presenting the forged check and
identifying the financial institution as the victim of the deceit.
290 Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property (except Arson)
To willfully or maliciously destroy, damage, deface, or otherwise injure any public or private
property without the consent of the owner or the person having custody or control of it.
As a general rule, LEAs should report this offense only if they deem substantial damage to
property has occurred, e.g., major structural damage, property damage generally classified as a
felony destruction of property. Agencies should not report insubstantial damage, such as a
broken window or other minor damage. The FBI’s UCR Program leaves the determination of
whether the damage was substantial to the discretion of the reporting LEA as it should not
require burdensome damage assessments.
Note: Agencies should report incidental damage resulting from another offense (e.g., Burglary
or Robbery) under 290 Destruction/Damage/Vandalism only if they deem the amount of
damage to be substantial. For Arson, agencies should include the incidental damage resulting
from fighting the fire as part of the loss caused by burning.
Scenarios:
Three teenage girls go to a new car dealership parking lot and bust the windows out of
several vehicles including six automobiles and two pick-up trucks. They caused $2,500 in
damages.
• The agency would report a 290 Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property due to
substantial damages.
• The agency would report 41 = Auto Dealership New/Used for Data Element 9 (Location
Type) and 4 = Destroyed/Damaged/Vandalized for Data Element 14 (Type Property

The front door of a community center, which is owned by a synagogue, was spray painted
with antisemitic messaging. The damages totaled approximately $150. Further investigation
determined this was a bias motivated crime against Jewish religious beliefs.
• The agency would report a 290 Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property offense.
• Although the damages may not be deemed substantial, the agency would still
report the 290 Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property due to the offense
being motivated by a bias. Any offense suspected to have been motivated, in
whole or in part, by bias against race/ethnicity/ancestry, religion, disability,
gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation is to be reported regardless of the
amount or type of damage.

270 Embezzlement
The unlawful misappropriation by an offender to his/her own use or purpose of money,
property, or some other thing of value entrusted to his/her care, custody, or control.
In general, an employer/employee or legal agent relationship must exist for Embezzlement to
occur. Typically, the victims of these offenses are businesses, financial institutions, etc.
Agencies must enter the type of victim in Data Element 25 (Type of Victim) (e.g., financial
institution, business, government, individual, religious organization, society/public, and other).
Scenarios:
A restaurant manager is in charge of depositing the restaurant’s cash in the bank. The
manager unlawfully withholds $500 for herself from the safe before she delivers and deposits
the remaining cash in the bank.
• The agency would report a 270 Embezzlement offense.
• The money in the safe is under the custody, care, or control of the manager.
• The agency would report B = Business in Data Element 25 (Type of Victim) for the
restaurant.
While passing the restaurant office, a restaurant server steals $500 from the safe when she
sees the safe door is open.
• The agency would report a 23D Theft from Building offense.
• The server is not responsible for the money in the safe. The money is not under her
care, custody, or control and should not be reported as a 270 Embezzlement offense.
Since she has legal access to the restaurant as an employee, this would be reported as a
23D Theft from Building offense.
• The agency would report B = Business in Data Element 25 (Type of Victim) for the
restaurant.
As the treasurer of their Homeowners Association (HOA), an individual steals money from the

103 Espionage*
The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving national security
or national defense information with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information
may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation.
Note: Only federal and tribal LEAs may report 103 Espionage offenses.
Scenarios:
A federal employee provided highly classified national security information to a foreign
country in exchange for $1.1 million in cash, bank funds, and jewels.
• The agency would report a 103 Espionage offense.
• The agency would report 48 = Documents/Personal or Business in Data Element 15

210 Extortion/Blackmail
To unlawfully obtain money, property, or any other thing of value, either tangible or
intangible, through the use or threat of force, misuse of authority, threat of criminal
prosecution, threat of destruction of reputation or social standing, or through other coercive
means.
Even though persons are involved or victimized in cases of 210 Extortion/Blackmail, the object
of these crimes is to obtain money, property, or intangibles (e.g., reputation); therefore, they
should be classified as Crimes Against Property.
Extortions include offenses where the offender made threats in non-confrontational
circumstances and the victim is not in fear of immediate harm. If during a demand for money,
property, etc., there is a personal confrontation between the victim and offender and the
offender has the opportunity to carry out the threat of force or violence immediately, the
agency should report the offense as 120 Robbery.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 32
If an LEA determines the 210 Extortion/Blackmail produced an intangible benefit (i.e.,
advantage or disadvantage), the agency must enter it as data value 66 = Identity-Intangible
(provided the agency has updated property descriptions) or 77 = Other in Data Element 15
(Property Description). Intangibles are anything a person cannot perceive by the sense of touch.
They can be a benefit (a right or privilege, a promotion, enhanced reputation, etc.) or a
detriment (the loss of reputation, injured feelings, etc.). 77 = Other should only be used for
identity intangibles when an agency has not programmed the new property descriptions.
Scenarios:
A victim and offender had an affair in the past, during which time, the victim sent the
offender nude photos of herself. The victim ended the affair. Now the man threatens the
woman that if she does not pay him $5, 500, he will tell her husband about the affair and
send those photos to her husband.
• The agency would report a 210 Extortion/Blackmail offense.
• The agency would report I = Individual in Data Element 25 (Type of Victim).
• If the victim did not give in to the offender’s demands, the agency would report A =
Attempted for Data Element 7 (Attempted/Completed/Unfounded) and 1 = None in
Data Element 14 (Type Property Loss/Etc.) and 20 = Money for Data Element 15
(Property Description).
A victim and offender had an affair in the past, during which time, the victim sent the
offender nude photos of herself. The victim ended the affair. The man has been threatening
the woman that if she does not pay him $5, 500, he will tell her husband about the affair and
send those nude photos to her husband. After she has continuously refused to pay, the man
follows her into a grocery store. He corners the victim, demands the money again, and
threatens to assault her if she does not pay.
• The agency would report a 120 Robbery offense since during a demand for money,
there was a personal confrontation between the victim and offender, and the offender
had the opportunity to carry out the threat of force or violence immediately.
26A – 26H Fraud Offenses (except Counterfeiting/Forgery)
The intentional perversion of the truth for the purpose of inducing another person or other
entity in reliance upon it to part with something of value or to surrender a legal right.
When classifying fraud cases other than the most obvious ones, e.g., con games, swindles, etc.,
agencies should use care in applying the facts of the case to the definition of Fraud. Often,
questions arise as to whether the facts of a case describe a Fraud or a Larceny. Though both
offenses can involve theft, it is the method used to steal that differentiates the two. Fraud is
achieved through deceit or lying; larceny, is the physical taking of something.
By definition, Fraud involves either the offender receiving a benefit or the victim incurring a
detriment. The benefit or detriment could be either tangible or intangible. Intangibles are
anything a person cannot perceive by the sense of touch. They can be a benefit (a right or
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 33
privilege, a promotion, enhanced reputation, etc.) or a detriment (the loss of reputation,
injured feelings, etc.). For example, if a person impersonates a doctor to gain entrance to a
restricted area of a hospital, the benefit to the offender (entry to the restricted area) is an
intangible.
The only fraud-related violations agencies should not report under the Fraud Offenses category
is 250 Counterfeiting/Forgery. These offenses have their own specific offense classifications.
Examples of common fraud involve cases in which an offender rents something of value, e.g.,
equipment or an automobile, for a time but does not return the item. Agencies should classify
this offense, conversion of goods lawfully possessed by a bailee, as Fraud and not Larceny. In
such cases, the offenders originally had lawful possession of the property (the property was
either rented or loaned) and through deceit (they promised to return it) kept the property.
A common classification problem is the taking of gasoline without paying for it. If an offender
steals gasoline from a self-service gas station without paying for it, the reporting agency should
classify the offense as a 23H All Other Larceny. In this case, the victim made no contract or
agreement for payment with the offender.
However, if someone gets gasoline at a full-service gas station and drives off without paying for
it, the offense is considered a 26A False Pretenses/Swindle/Confidence Game. The individual
asked someone to provide a service and product to them and failed to pay for it (they made a
tacit agreement for product and services rendered).
Note: Agencies should report the most specific subcategory of fraud whenever the
circumstances fit the definition of more than one of the subcategories listed below. For
example, many frauds would fit the definition of 26A False Pretenses/Swindle/Confidence
Game. However, if the offender used a credit card to perpetrate the Fraud, the agency should
classify the offense as 26B Credit Card/Automated Teller Machine Fraud.
26A False Pretenses/Swindle/Confidence Game
The intentional misrepresentation of existing fact or condition or the use of some other
deceptive scheme or device to obtain money, goods, or other things of value. Only includes
fraud offenses that do not fit any of the definitions of the specific subcategories of fraud.
This term applies to the premeditated and calculated act that misrepresents the facts or a
situation in order to defraud (false pretenses) and cheating and defrauding grossly with
deliberate artifice (swindling).
Acquisition of personal or movable property, money, or instrument of writing conveying or
securing a valuable right, by means of some false or deceitful pretense or device, or fraudulent
representation, with intent to appropriate the same to use of the party so acquiring, or of
destroying or impairing the rights of the party justly entitled to the same (swindling).
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 34
Applies to a swindle where the swindler gains the confidence of the person he is trying swindle
(confidence game).
26B Credit Card/Automated Teller Machine Fraud
The unlawful use of a credit/debit card, credit/debit card number, or automatic teller
machine for fraudulent purposes.
This offense does not apply to the theft of a credit/debit card but rather its fraudulent use.
26C Impersonation
Unlawfully representing one’s position and acting in the character or position to deceive
others and thereby gain a profit or advantage, or enjoy some right or privilege.
Note: If a credit card number is fraudulently used, LEAs should report this as a
26B = Credit Card Fraud.
Example:
In order to receive special discounts from a business an individual put on a military uniform and
enters the business. The individual is not a military service member and uses the fake uniform
with the purpose of impersonating a service member to receive a discount.
26D Welfare Fraud
The use of deceitful statements, practices, or devices to unlawfully obtain welfare benefits.
Includes electronic benefit transfer (EBT) card when utilized with a welfare transaction.
26E Wire Fraud
The use of an electric or electronic communications facility to intentionally transmit a false
and/or deceptive message in furtherance of a fraudulent activity.
This classification applies to those cases where telephone, teletype, computers, e-mail, text
messages, etc., are used in the commission or furtherance of a fraud. For example, if someone
uses a computer to order products through a fraudulent online auction site and pays for the
products but never receives them, LEAs should classify the incident as 26E = Wire Fraud.
26F Identity Theft
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 35
Wrongfully obtaining and/or using another person’s personal data (e.g., name and date of
birth, Social Security number, driver’s license number).
This offense includes opening a credit card, bank account, etc. using a person’s information.
This offense should not be confused with Impersonation (26C) (falsely acting in the character or
position to unlawfully deceive others to gain a profit or advantage; when impersonating
another person, the offender would not be in possession of another person’s personal data).
26G Hacking/Computer Invasion
Gaining access to another person’s or institution’s computer software, hardware, or networks
without authorized permissions.
26H Money Laundering*
The process of transforming the profits of a crime into a legitimate asset.

LEAs should report the circumstances of a homicide in Data Element 31 (Aggravated
Assault/Homicide Circumstances).
09A Murder and Nonnegligent Manslaughter
The willful (nonnegligent) killing of one human being by another.
As a general rule, agencies should classify in this category any death due to injuries received in
a fight, argument, quarrel, assault, or commission of a crime. Although law enforcement
agencies may charge offenders with lesser offenses, e.g., negligent manslaughter, agencies
should report the offense as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter if the killing was willful or
intentional.
Agencies should not classify suicides, traffic fatalities (including those involving driving under
the influence), fetal deaths, assaults to murder, attempted murders, or accidental deaths as
murder and nonnegligent manslaughter.
Situations in which a victim dies of a heart attack as a result of a crime being committed against
them do not meet the criteria for inclusion as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter.
Note: The findings of a court, coroner’s inquest, etc., should not influence the reporting of
offenses in this category.

09C Justifiable Homicide (Not a Crime)
The lawful killing of a perpetrator of a serious criminal offense by a law enforcement officer
in the line of duty, or the lawful killing, during the commission of a serious criminal offense,
of the offender by a private individual.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 41
Justifiable Homicide, by definition, always occurs in conjunction with a serious criminal offense
(i.e., a felony or high misdemeanor). Agencies must report the crime that was being committed
when the Justifiable Homicide took place as a separate incident. The definition of an incident
requires all offenders to act in concert. Certainly, the criminal killed justifiably did not act in
concert with the police officer or civilian who killed him; likewise, the police officer or civilian
who killed the criminal did not act in concert with the criminal in committing the offense that
resulted in the Justifiable Homicide. Therefore, Justifiable Homicide cases involve at least two
incidents rather than one. If the “justified” killer committed another offense in connection with
the Justifiable Homicide (e.g., illegal possession of the gun he/she used), the LEA should report
a third incident.
LE must report the additional circumstances regarding a Justifiable Homicide in Data Element
32 (Additional Justifiable Homicide Circumstances).
Scenarios:
A police officer answered a bank alarm and surprised the robber coming out of the bank. The
robber saw the responding officer and fired at him. The officer returned fire, killing the
robber.
• The agency would report two separate incidents.
• The agency would report 09C Justifiable Homicide offense on one incident and report
21 = Criminal Killed by Police Officer in Data Element 31 (Aggravated Assault/Homicide
Circumstances).
• The agency would report a 120 Robbery offense and a 13A Aggravated Assault offense
on a separate incident to account for the serious criminal offense taking place at the
time of the killing.
• The agency would report the victim of the 13A Aggravated Assault and L = Law
Enforcement Officer. The agency will report the victims of the 120 Robbery as F =
Financial Institution for the bank and I = Individual for anyone towards whom the
robber(s) directed force or threat of force in perpetrating the offense (i.e., the teller,
patrons in lobby, etc.) in Data Element 25 (Type of Victim). Robbery includes not only
those persons and other entities (businesses, financial institutions, etc.) from whom
property was taken (or was attempted to be taken), but also those persons toward
whom the robber(s) directed force or threat of force in perpetrating the offense.
When a gunman entered a store and attempted to rob the proprietor, the storekeeper shot
and killed the gunman.

100 Kidnapping/Abduction
The unlawful seizure, transportation, and/or detention of a person against their will or of a
minor without the consent of a custodial parent(s) or legal guardian.
Kidnapping/Abduction includes domestic violence with detainment, hostage, and parental
abduction situations. This offense is the only Crime Against Person for which LEAs must report
property information. In such cases, the property segment is necessary to report information
regarding any ransom paid for the victim’s release. Although the object of a kidnapping may be
to obtain money or property, LEAs may only report the persons actually kidnapped, abducted,
or detained against their will as victims for this offense type. Those persons or organizations
paying ransoms must not be counted as victims for Kidnapping/Abduction offenses.
By definition, every 120 Robbery and 11A Rape situation could be considered as a kidnapping
because the victim is being detailed against their will. Although possible, generally kidnapping
should not be reported in addition to robbery and/or rape incident(s).
Note: If no ransom is paid, Data Element 14 (Type Property Loss/Etc.) must be reported as
1 = None.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 45
Scenarios:
Officers responded to a domestic violence call in which the intoxicated husband had detained
his wife against her will in the bathroom. Once on the scene, the officers interviewed the
victim and she stated her husband punched her in the face twice and blocked the door,
detaining her in the bathroom. The woman sustained minor injuries such as bruising.
• The agency would report a 13B Simple Assault offense and a 100 Kidnapping offense.
• Since the 100 Kidnapping offense is the only Crime Against Person for which LEAs must
report property information, the agency would report 1 = None for Data Element 14
(Type Property Loss/Etc.), as no ransom was paid for the victim’s release.
• The agency would report M = Apparent Minor Injury in Data Element 33 (Type Injury).
A gunman entered a bank and loudly demanded money from the bank teller. There were five
customers in the lobby as well. As soon as the robber received the money, he exited the
bank.
• The agency would report a 120 Robbery offense.
• The agency would not report a 100 Kidnapping offense as by definition, every 120
Robbery situation could be considered as a kidnapping because the victim is being
detained against their will. Although possible, generally kidnapping should not be
reported in addition to robbery/rape incidents unless a hostage situation arises. See the
following scenario, which describes a hostage situation.
Two gunmen enter a bank and loudly demand money from the bank teller. There were five
customers in the lobby as well. One gunman told everyone to lie on the floor. Police arrived
on the scene. The victims were detained as hostages while the offenders attempted to
negotiate a getaway with the police.
• The agency would report a 120 Robbery offense and a 100 Kidnapping offense.
• The agency would report a 100 Kidnapping offense in addition to the 120 Robbery
offense as the incident includes a hostage situation.
• Since the 100 Kidnapping offense is the only Crime Against Person for which LEAs must
report property information, the agency would report 1 = None for Data Element 14
(Type Property Loss/Etc.), as no ransom was paid for the victim’s release.
• For the 120 Robbery, the agency will report the victims as F = Financial Institution for
the bank and I = Individual for the five customers and one bank teller in Data Element 25
(Type of Victim). Robbery includes not only those persons and other entities
(businesses, financial institutions, etc.) from whom property was taken (or attempted to
be taken), but also those persons toward whom the robber(s) directed force or threat of
force in perpetrating the offense.
• For the 100 Kidnapping, the agency will report the victims as I = Individual for the five
customers and one bank teller in Data Element 25 (Type of Victim).

23A – 23H Larceny/Theft Offenses
The attempted or unlawful taking, carrying, leading, or riding away of property from the
possession or constructive possession of another person.
Larceny and Theft mean the same thing in the FBI’s UCR Program. Local offense classifications
such as grand theft, petty larceny, felony larceny, or misdemeanor larceny have no bearing on
the fact that LEAs should report one offense for each distinct operation of such larcenies for
UCR purposes, regardless of the value of the property stolen.
When multiple types of Larceny/Theft occur within a single incident, agencies should report all
types of Larceny/Theft involved. LEAs should report multiple Larceny/Theft offenses because
these offenses are not inherent.
For example, if an individual stole a factory-installed radio valued at $600 and a laptop
computer valued at $1,500 from a motor vehicle in the same incident, the agency should report
both offenses—23G Theft of Motor Vehicle Parts or Accessories for the radio and a 23F Theft
From Motor Vehicle for the laptop.
The FBI’s UCR Program does not include 240 Motor Vehicle Theft in the Larceny/Theft offense
category. Because of the great volume of such thefts, the FBI’s UCR Program counts these
offenses separately.
Agencies should enter the type of property that was the object of the theft in Data Element 15
(Property Description).
23A Pocket-picking
The theft of articles from another person’s physical possession by stealth where the victim is
not immediately aware a theft occurred.
This type of theft includes removal of such items as wallets from purse and pockets and usually
occurs in a crowded area or on public transportation to disguise the activity. Agencies should
also classify a theft from a person in an unconscious state, including an individual who is drunk,
as 23A Pocket-picking.
If the offender manhandled the victim in any way or used force beyond simple jostling to
overcome the victim’s resistance, the agency must classify the offense as a 120 Robbery.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 47
Scenario:
A man noticed his wallet was missing after riding the public transportation system. He is
certain he had his wallet in his back pocket when he got on the subway. The man remembers
someone bumping into his back on the subway and is certain that is when his wallet was
stolen. The man had a driver’s license, credit cards, and $20 cash in his wallet.
• The agency would report a 23A Pocket-picking offense since the theft occurred by
stealth.
• The agency would report 7 = Stolen for Data Element 14 (Type Property Loss/Etc.). The
agency would report data values 25 = Purse/Handbags/Wallets, 65 = Identity
Documents, 09 = Credit/Debit Cards, and 20 = Money for Data Element 15 (Property
Description).
• The agency would report the data value $0 for the driver’s license and credit cards in
Data Element 16 (Value of Property). The data values of 65=Identity Documents and
09 = Credit/Debit Cards have a mandatory zero value.
• The agency would report the data value $20 for the money in Data Element 16 (Value of
Property). The agency would report the value of the wallet in Data Element 16 (Value of
Property).
23B Purse-snatching
The grabbing or snatching of a purse, handbag, etc., from the physical possession of another
person.
Examples of 23B Purse-snatching as identified in Data Element 15 (Property Description) data
value 25 = Purses/Handbags/Wallets are bags or pouches used for carrying articles such as
money, credit/debit cards, keys, photographs, and other miscellaneous items; briefcases, fanny
packs, and backpacks when used as a purse or wallet.
If the offender used more force than was necessary to snatch the purse from the grasp of the
victim, or if the victim resists the theft in any way, then classify the incident as a 120 Robbery.
If the victim left a purse or other item of value unattended in a location which was open to the
general public and the item was subsequently stolen, the agency should classify the incident as
23D Theft From Building, 23F Theft From Motor Vehicle, or other appropriate Larceny category
and not as a 23B Purse-snatching. Purse-Snatching only applies when the victim has physical
possession of the item (i.e., it is on the victim’s person).
Scenario:
A woman was walking into a grocery store when an unknown male ran by her and grabbed
her purse out of her hand. The woman had a wallet in her purse, which included her driver’s
license, credit cards, and $15 cash.
• The agency would report a 23B Purse-snatching offense since the victim had physical
possession of the purse.

Money for Data Element 15 (Property Description).
23C Shoplifting
The unlawful taking of goods or merchandise exposed for sale by a person (other than an
employee).
This violation assumes the offender had legal access to the premises, and thus, no trespass or
unlawful entry was involved. This offense includes thefts of merchandise displayed as part of
the stock in trade outside of buildings such as department stores, hardware stores,
supermarkets, and fruit stands.
Scenario:
A woman puts makeup in her purse in a department store. She is seen by a plain clothes
officer. Before leaving the store, she is stopped by the store manager and willingly gives back
the makeup.
• The agency would report a 23C Shoplifting offense.
• The agency would report A = Attempted in Data Element 7 (Offense
Attempted/Completed/Unfounded) since the woman did not leave the store with the
merchandise.
• This agency would report 1 = None for Data Element 14 (Type Property Loss/Etc.) since
this was an attempted shoplifting.
A woman puts makeup in her purse in a department store. She is seen by security on camera,
but security is unable to stop her from leaving the building. After reviewing the video
footage, security identifies the woman and reports that the woman has previously been
removed and banned from the department store for a prior shoplifting incident.
• The agency would report a 220 Burglary/Breaking & Entering offense since the woman
has unlawfully entered the building to commit a theft.

• The agency would report C = Completed in Data Element 7 (Offense
Attempted/Completed/Unfounded) since the woman unlawfully gained access to the
building to commit a theft.
An employee in a department store electronics section is responsible for inventorying all
televisions on the sales floor. The employee steals a television by taking it off of the shelf,
marking it off the inventory list, and taking it home with her.
• The agency would report a 270 Embezzlement offense.
• The televisions in the store are under the care, custody, or control of the employee, thus
a 270 Embezzlement offense would apply, even though the television is merchandise in
the department store.
• The agency would report 7=Stolen for Data Element 14 (Type Property Loss/Etc.). The
agency would report a data value 26 = Radios/TVs/VCRs/DVD Players for Data Element
15 (Property Description).
23D Theft From Building
The unlawful taking of items from within a building which is either open to the general public
or to which the offender has legal access.
Law enforcement should report a theft from a structure where the offender entered the
structure illegally as 220 Burglary/Breaking & Entering.
23D Theft From Building includes thefts from such places as churches, restaurants, schools,
libraries, public buildings, and other public and professional offices during the hours when such
facilities are open to the public. This also applies to private residences when lawful access has
been granted. Agencies should not include 23C Shoplifting and 23E Thefts From Coin-Operated
Machines or Devices within open buildings, but should classify these as other specific larceny
types.
Scenarios:
A man invites a woman over to his house to have dinner. During the visit, the woman takes
$200 from the man’s wallet that was sitting on the kitchen counter. The man notices the
money missing immediately after the woman leaves and reports it to law enforcement.
• The agency would report a 23D Theft From Building offense since the woman had legal
access to the residence as she was invited over.

her home, he takes $200 from the woman’s purse.
• The agency would report a 23D Theft From Building offense since the offender had legal
access to the residence.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 50
• Although the offender is an employee of the woman, the agency would not report a
270 Embezzlement offense because the woman’s money is not entrusted to the
offender. The woman’s money is not under the offender’s care, custody, or control.
• The agency would report 7 = Stolen for Data Element 14 (Type Property Loss/Etc.). The
agency would report the data value 20 = Money for Data Element 15 (Property

The unlawful taking of articles from a motor vehicle, locked or unlocked.
This type of Larceny includes thefts from automobiles, trucks, attached truck trailers, buses,
motorcycles, motor homes, or other recreational vehicles. It also includes thefts from any area
in the automobile or other type of vehicle, e.g., the trunk, glove compartment, or other
enclosure.
Some of the items stolen in this type of theft are cameras, suitcases, apparel, packages, etc.,
that are not an integral part of the vehicle.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 51
Agencies should not include items considered automobile accessories, as they fall under 23G
Theft of Motor Vehicle Parts and Accessories.
For Larceny situations in which offenders steal both articles from the motor vehicle and motor
vehicle parts and accessories, agencies should report 23F Theft From Motor Vehicle and 23G
Theft of Motor Vehicle Parts and Accessories with each corresponding property type/loss.
Certain state statutes might interpret 23F Thefts From Motor Vehicles as Burglaries. However,
agencies must classify these offenses as larcenies for UCR purposes. If a 23F Theft From a
Motor Vehicle occurs in conjunction with a 240 Motor Vehicle Theft, the agency will report the
incident as a 240 Motor Vehicle Theft and record the stolen property within the appropriate
property-type categories.
Scenario:
A man reported several power tools were stolen from the bed of his company pickup truck
while it was parked on the street.

wheel covers, manufacturers’ emblems, license plates, side-view mirrors, siphoned gasoline,
built-in DVD players, mounted GPS devices, catalytic converter, tires on car, etc.
If items stolen were not part of the vehicle and were only being transported in the vehicle when
stolen, the reporting agency should classify the offense as 23F Theft From Motor Vehicle.
Scenario:
A catalytic converter was stolen from a vehicle in a residential driveway. Video surveillance
shows a male slide under the car and saw off the catalytic converter while another male kept
a look out for anyone passing by. The owner of the car reported $1,000 damage.
• The agency would report a 23G Theft of Motor Vehicle Parts offense and a 290
Destruction Damage and Vandalism offense due to the substantial damages.
• According to the FBI’s UCR Program, substantial damage is anything exceeding $249 in
value and can include major structural damage and property damage.

travel trailer used for recreational purposes, followed by a theft or attempted theft. Examples
of items stolen from areas in which the offender did not break into a structure are thefts of
animals, lawnmowers, lawn furniture, hand tools, and farm and construction equipment.
Agencies should also classify instances that the offender takes gasoline from a self-service gas
station and leaves without paying as 23H All Other Larceny.
Scenario:
An industrial business owner reported the theft of a utility trailer from the business parking
lot in a gated area. The trainer was being stored and was not hitched to a vehicle.
Investigation shows the suspect slipped through a hole in the fence to unlock and open the
gate from the inside.

Loss/Etc.). The agency would report the data value 78 = Trailers for Date Element 15
(Property Description).
240 Motor Vehicle Theft
The theft of a motor vehicle.
A motor vehicle is a self-propelled vehicle that runs on the surface of land and not on rails that
is not proceeds of another crime and that fits one of the following descriptions:
• Automobiles—sedans, coupes, station wagons, convertibles, taxicabs, or other similar
motor vehicles serving the primary purpose of transporting people
This classification also includes minivans (which primarily transport people), automobiles
used as taxis; sport-utility vehicles, such as Explorers, Highlanders, 4Runners, Pathfinders,
and Hummers; and automobile derivative vehicles, such as Ranchero, El Camino, Caballero,
and Brat.
• Buses—motor vehicles specifically designed (but not necessarily used) to transport groups
of people on a commercial basis

• Recreational Vehicles—motor vehicles specifically designed (but not necessarily used) to
transport people and provide them with temporary lodging for recreational purposes
• Trucks—motor vehicles specifically designed (but not necessarily used) to transport cargo
on a commercial basis
Pickup trucks and pickup trucks with campers should be classified as 37 = Trucks, as they
meet the definition specifically designed, but not necessarily used, to transport cargo.
• Other Motor Vehicles–other motorized vehicles, e.g., motorcycles, motor scooters, trail
bikes, mopeds, snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles (i.e., side-by-sides), or golf carts whose
primary purpose is to transport people
Using the vehicle descriptions above, agencies should enter the type of motor vehicle in Data
Element 15 (Property Description).
Note: LEAs should classify full-size vans, both regular wheelbase and extended wheelbase, as
buses, recreational vehicles, or trucks depending upon their configuration, e.g., vans with rows
of seats (buses), custom vans with temporary lodging accommodations (recreational vehicles),
and work vans with primarily cargo areas (trucks).
Agencies should report incidences of carjacking as 120=Robbery, with the type of vehicle taken
(automobile, truck, etc.) identified in the property description. The offense of 240 Motor
Vehicle Theft is not to be identified as an additional offense, as the stolen motor vehicle is the
proceeds of the offense of robbery, and not a separate, distinct operation. Consequently, Data
Element 18 (Number of Stolen Motor Vehicles) and Data Element 19 (Number of Recovered
Motor Vehicles) are not used.
When the offender takes a motor vehicle from the garage of a house during a Burglary, the LEA
should report the offense as 220 Burglary/Breaking & Entering and should identify the type of
vehicle taken (automobile, truck, etc.) in the property description. The offense 240 Motor
Vehicle Theft is not to be identified as an additional offense because the stolen motor vehicle is
the proceeds of the burglary, and not a separate, distinct operation. Consequently, Data
Element 18 (Number of Stolen Motor Vehicles) and Data Element 19 (Number of Recovered
Motor Vehicles) are not used.
Agencies should classify incidents as 240 Motor Vehicle Theft when persons not having lawful
access take automobiles even if the vehicles were later abandoned, e.g., joyriding. Agencies
should not include the taking of a vehicle for temporary use when prior authority has been
granted or can be assumed, such as in family situations; or unauthorized use by chauffeurs and
others having lawful access to the vehicle. Other Group A offenses may have occurred in these
situations. For example, if a chauffeur steals a car entrusted to his care, the responding agency
should report 270 Embezzlement.

suspect stole the pickup truck, which was parked in the driveway.
• The agency would report a 220 Burglary/Breaking & Entering offense and a 240 Motor
Vehicle Theft offense.
• Since the pickup truck was parked outside the structure, it is not deemed proceeds of
the burglary and should be reported as a separate offense of 240 Motor Vehicle Theft.
• The agency would report the data value 7=Stolen for Data Element 14 (Type Property

120 Robbery
The taking or attempting to take anything of value from the control, custody, or care of
another person by force or threat of force and/or by putting the victim in fear of immediate
harm.
Robbery involves the offender taking or attempting to take something of value from a victim,
usually the property owner or custodian, by the use of force or threat of force. (The victim must
be present.) If there is no direct confrontation and the victim is not in fear of immediate harm,
LE should report 210 Extortion/Blackmail. Though direct confrontation occurs in 23A Pocket-
pickings or 23B Purse-snatchings, force or threat of force is absent. However, if during a 23B
Purse-snatching or other such crime, the offender uses force or threat of force to overcome the
active resistance of the victim, LE should classify the offense as 120 Robbery.
Because assault is an element of robbery, law enforcement should not report assault as a
separate crime as long as the offender committed the assault in furtherance of the robbery.
However, if the injury results in death, law enforcement must also report a homicide offense.
For the 120 Robbery offense, LE should enter the type of weapon/force used (or threatened)
and the resulting injury in Data Element 13 (Type Weapon/Force Involved) and Data Element 33
(Type Injury).
As in the case of all Crimes Against Property, LE should report only one offense for each distinct
operation of 120 Robbery, regardless of the number of victims involved. However, the victims
of a 120 Robbery include not only those persons and other entities (businesses, financial
institutions, etc.) from whom property was taken (or was attempted to be taken), but also
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 57
those persons toward whom the robber(s) directed force or threat of force in perpetrating the
offense. Therefore, although the primary victim in a bank robbery would be the financial
institution, LE should report as a victim the teller toward whom the robber pointed a gun and
made a demand, as well as any other person against whom the offender committed an assault
during the course of the Robbery.
Scenario:
A woman entered a convenience store, yelled “I have a gun. Everyone on the floor—face
down!” and demanded money from the cashier. There were five customers in the store as
well. As soon as the offender received the money, she exited the store. Neither the cashier
nor the customers saw the weapon.
• The agency would report a 120 Robbery offense.
• The agency would report I = Individual in Data Element 25 (Type of Victim) for the six
individuals in the store which include the cashier and five customers. The agency would
also report B = Business in Data Element 25 (Type of Victim) for the convenience store.
• The agency would report 11 = Firearm in Data Element 13 (Type Weapon/Force
Involved) since the offender claimed to have a gun, but no one saw the firearm to
identify the specific type.
• If the investigation determined it was a pretend gun, the agency would report 1 = None
in Data Element 13 (Type Weapon/Force Involved).
A woman entered a convenience store and yelled, "I have a gun. Everyone on the floor – face
down!” and demanded money from the cashier. There were five customers in the store as

passing law enforcement officer who had witnessed the hold up. The officer determined that
the offender had a pretend firearm.
• The agency would report a 120 Robbery offense.
• The agency would report I = Individual in Data Element 25 (Type of Victim) for the six
individuals in the store which include the cashier and five customers. The agency would

previous incident report) in Data Element 43 (Type of Arrest).
11A – 11D Sex Offenses
Any sexual act directed against another person, without the consent of the victim, including
instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 58
11A Rape (except Statutory Rape)
Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral
penetration by a sex organ of another person, or by a sex-related object. This definition also
includes instances in which the victim is incapable of giving consent because of temporary or
permanent mental or physical incapacity (including due to the influence of drugs or alcohol)
or because of age. Physical resistance is not required on the part of the victim to demonstrate
lack of consent.
Agencies should classify the crime as 11A Rape, regardless of the age or gender of the victim or
offender, if the victim did not consent or if the victim was incapable of giving consent. If the
victim consented, the offender did not force or threaten the victim, and the victim was under
the statutory age of consent, agencies should classify the crime as 36B Statutory Rape.
In cases where several offenders rape one person, the responding agency should count one
offense of 11A Rape (for one victim) and report separate offender information for each
offender.
Note: 11B Sodomy and 11C Sexual Assault with an Object may still be reported to the FBI’s UCR
Program and will be reclassified and recoded under the broader category of 11A = Rape.

90Z All Other Offenses
All crimes that are not Group A offenses and not included in one of the specifically named
Group B crime categories listed previously.
This category includes Offenses of General Applicability if the substantive offense is a Group A
offense unless it is an integral component of the Group A offense such as human trafficking.
Offenses of General Applicability are those offenses prefixed by Accessory Before/After the
Fact, Aiding and Abetting, Assault to Commit, Conspiracy to Commit, Enticement, Facilitation of,
Solicitation to Commit, Threat to Commit, or any other prefix identifying it as other than the
substantive offense.
Generally, this category excludes traffic offenses. However, the vehicle-related offenses of Hit
and Run (of a person) and Vehicular Manslaughter, along with Driving Under the Influence,
which is a separate Group B offense, have their own categories. Hit and Run (of a person) and
Vehicular Manslaughter incidents could be Group A or Group B offenses depending on the
circumstances of the incidents. Driving Under the Influence offenses should be classified as the
Group B offense of 90D = Driving Under the Influence.
2.5 Offense Lookup Table
Once LE has classified offenses involved in an incident according to its own offense definitions,
they should use the Offense Lookup Table to determine whether the offenses are Group A or
Group B offenses in NIBRS. The Offense Lookup Table lists various types of crime, whether the
crime is a Group A or Group B offense, and the NIBRS crime category covering the offense. For
example, the crime of Abduction is listed as a Group A offense covered by the crime category
Kidnapping/Abduction. In addition, the table includes the notational reminder “Other offenses
may have been committed” for crimes most likely to involve companion offenses.

3 Electronic File Submissions
In NIBRS, LEAs use three types of electronic submissions to forward data to the FBI:
• The Group A Incident Report provides all the information about Group A offenses using
up to six data segments Administrative, Offense, Property, Victim, Offender, and
Arrestee.
• The Group B Arrest Report supplies data concerning each arrestee for a Group B offense
via the arrestee segment.
• The Zero Report, which indicates no criminal activity occurred within an agency’s
jurisdiction during a given month.
Using a series of the 58 established data elements (i.e., data fields within each segment), LE can
describe the details of each component of the crime. For each data element, reporting agencies
should choose the most appropriate data value (i.e., a specific code representing one of the
acceptable entries for each data element).
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 89
3.1 Group A Incident Report
An initial Group A Incident Report contains an Administrative Segment, Offense Segment(s),
Property Segment(s) (if applicable), Victim Segment(s), and Offender Segment(s). If the
reporting agency arrests an offender by the time it submits the initial report, it may also include
one or more Arrestee Segments. If, however, the reporting agency arrests an offender for the
reported offense after submitting the initial report, the agency should submit the Arrestee
Segment(s) as an update to the initial report.
If LE arrests an offender for a Group A offense for which it did not previously submit an initial
incident report (e.g., an on-view arrest), the agency must create and submit a Group A Incident
Report that provides not only the Arrestee Segment but also the Administrative, Offense,
Property (if applicable), Victim, and Offender Segments. In other words, an agency cannot
submit an Arrestee Segment for a Group A offense without the other segment information.
Note: Sometimes courts apply for warrants without notifying LEAs of the details of the crime
(e.g., bench warrant and warrant of arrest situations). As often as possible, LEAs should obtain
the information regarding such crimes and report it in Group A Incident Reports or Group B
Arrest Reports, depending on whether the crimes are Group A or Group B offenses.
An explanation of the purpose of each of the six Group A Incident Report segments follows:
Administrative Segment
This segment contains administrative data that applies to the entire incident report (e.g., the
identifying number assigned to the incident and the date and hour the incident occurred). The
reporting agency should submit a single Administrative Segment for each reported incident.
Note: NIBRS Data Element 1 (ORI Number) and Data Element 2 (Incident Number) link the
Administrative Segment to the Offense, Property, Victim, Offender, and Arrestee Segments in
each incident.
Offense Segment
The Offense Segment identifies and describes the types of offenses involved in the incident
(e.g., 200 = Arson, 40A = Prostitution). The reporting agency should submit an Offense Segment
for each of the (up to) ten most serious (as determined by the agency) Group A offenses in the
incident. Even though there may have been more than one victim of a particular crime, the
reporting agency should submit only one Offense Segment for each reported UCR Offense
Code. Each Group A Incident Report must contain at least one Offense Segment.
For example, in the same incident, an offender assaulted two people by threatening them with
a handgun. The reporting agency should submit only one Offense Segment with
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 90
13A = Aggravated Assault entered into Data Element 6 (UCR Offense Code). In addition, the
agency should submit two Victim Segments and enter 13A = Aggravated Assault into Data
Element 24 (Victim Connected to UCR Offense Code), to link the two victims to this Offense
Segment.
Property Segment
The Property Segment describes the type, value, and, in cases of drug seizures, quantity of
property involved in the incident. Agencies should report Property Segment(s) only when an
incident involves a Crime Against Property offense, a Kidnapping/Abduction offense, Drug
Narcotic Offenses, or Gambling Offenses. The reporting agency should submit a separate
Property Segment for each type of property loss/etc. (e.g., burned; counterfeited/forged;
destroyed/damaged/vandalized; recovered; seized; and/or stolen/etc. occurring in the
incident). Furthermore, the agency may report up to ten types of property (e.g., aircraft,
alcohol, and automobiles) for each type of property loss/etc.
Victim Segment
The Victim Segment provides information about each of the victims involved in the incident
(e.g., his/her age, sex, race, and ethnicity). The reporting agency should submit a separate
Victim Segment for each of the (up to 999) victims involved in the incident. At least one Victim
Segment must be in each Incident Report.
Offender Segment
The Offender Segment captures data about each of the offenders in the incident (e.g., his/her
age, sex, race, and ethnicity). The reporting agency should submit a separate Offender Segment
for each of the (up to 99) offenders involved in the incident. If the reporting agency knows
nothing about the offenders—i.e., no one saw the offenders, there were no suspects, and the
number of offenders is unknown—then the agency should enter 00 = Unknown as the data
value for Data Element 36 (Offender Sequence Number), and leave Data Elements 37 through
39A blank. There must be at least one Offender Segment in each incident report.
Arrestee Segment
The Arrestee Segment is used to report the apprehension of the person(s) arrested for
committing the crime(s) reported in the Group A Incident Report, the offense for which he or
she was arrested, and the arrestee data (e.g., his/her age, sex, race, and ethnicity). The
reporting agency should submit an Arrestee Segment for each of the (up to 99) arrestees who
were involved in the incident. However, if there were no arrestees, the agency should not
submit this segment.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 91
3.2 Group B Arrest Report
The Group B Arrest Report describes only the circumstances of the arrest, the Group B arrest
offense, and the arrestee data (e.g., his/her age, sex, race, and ethnicity). This report does not
include incident data since agencies report only arrests for Group B offenses. Reporting
agencies should submit a separate Group B Arrest Report for each arrestee.
If an arrest for a Group B offense results in the clearance of a previously submitted Group A
Incident Report, the reporting agency should submit an Arrestee Segment as an update to the
previously submitted Group A Incident Report. The agency should enter the appropriate
Group B offense code as the data value for Data Element 45 (UCR Arrest Offense Code) of the
Arrestee Segment of the Group A Incident Report.
For example, on August 1, 2024, a LEA arrested a man for DUI, a Group B offense. The arresting
agency determined he was also wanted for a previously reported robbery, a Group A offense,
which occurred on March 23, 2024. Instead of submitting a Group B Arrest Report, the
reporting agency should submit an Arrestee Segment as an update to the previous Group A
Incident Report with 90D = Driving Under the Influence as the data value for Data Element 45.
3.3 Zero Report
On occasion, a small reporting agency may have no crime, arrests, or recovered property to
report for a given month. In such instances, reporting agencies should use the Zero Report. This
assists the FBI to compute valid statistics because it establishes no crime occurred in the
jurisdiction rather than the LEA reported no crime information. If an agency submits a Zero
Report for a given month and subsequently enters a Group A Incident Report, a Group B Arrest
Report, or an Arrestee Segment for the month, the submission will override the Zero Report.
3.4 Report Modifications
Clearing Incidents in NIBRS
In NIBRS, LEAs clear incidents rather than individual offenses. This means a clearance by arrest
or exceptional means of one offense in a multiple-offense incident clears the entire incident.
Therefore, the first Arrestee Segment reported in connection with an incident automatically
clears the incident. However, an agency cannot clear an incident by exceptional means if it was
already cleared by arrest (i.e., the agency previously submitted an Arrestee Segment).
Updating Incidents in NIBRS
Once LEAs submit incidents to the FBI’s UCR Program, circumstances may arise that warrant
updating their original submissions. The flexibility of NIBRS provides for updating reports by
adding, modifying, and deleting data. The FBI’s UCR Program updating policy states, an agency
should update a report only if the change would substantially alter the report’s statistical
significance. More specifically, if a subsequent event materially affects the report, or if the LEA
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 92
made a serious error when it submitted the original report, the LEA will need to update the
report. Anytime an agency updates a report, the agency should resubmit the report so the data
are the same at all levels—federal, state, county, city, university and college, and tribal.
Examples of circumstances requiring an update include the discovery of an additional
unreported offense, victim, and/or offender; a subsequent arrest or exceptional clearance;
discovery of a significant amount of unreported property loss; the recovery of stolen property;
or the incorrect entry of important data, such as the offense code, the victim’s or arrestee’s sex
or race, etc.
Examples of circumstances not requiring an update include the agency learning the exact age of
the offender (e.g., 22) after reporting an age range (e.g., 20-25); the agency learning the true
value of stolen property (e.g., $958) after reporting the approximate cost (e.g., $1,000); or the
agency learning, besides suffering a severe laceration previously reported, the victim also
suffered internal injury.
An agency participating in NIBRS may, of course, update more data than is required by the FBI’s
UCR Program policy. If a reporting state UCR Program (or a direct agency participant) updates a
record in its RMS, it should also submit the updated record for the national file.
LEAs can find additional information about adding, deleting, and modifying information in
NIBRS in the NIBRS Technical Specification, NIBRS Extensible Markup Language (XML)
Developer’s Guide, or the NIBRS Information Exchange Package Documentation (IEPD).
Note: The NIBRS Technical Specification, NIBRS XML Developer’s Guide, and the NIBRS IEPD are
companion documents to the NIBRS User Manual. These documents define the requirements
sets (data elements) used to submit data for NIBRS. The NIBRS User Manual is the technical
communication document designed to assist the users of NIBRS.
4 Data Elements and Data Values
LEAs use data elements and data values to report data to the FBI’s UCR Program via NIBRS.
Additional information about reporting requirements and specifications for submitting data to
NIBRS is in the NIBRS Technical Specification and NIBRS XML Developer’s Guide.
4.1 Definition of Data Element
A data element is the smallest named item of data that conveys meaningful information or
condenses a lengthy description into a short code. LE should use a series of the 58 established
data elements (i.e., data fields) within each segment of the Group A Incident Report and in the
Group B Arrest Report to describe the details of each component of crime.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 93
4.2 Mandatory Versus Optional Data Elements
LEAs must report some data elements that are required in order to have a complete/valid data
submission, i.e., they are mandatory. Other data elements are conditional based on the data
values submitted for the other data elements. Other data elements are optional and can be
reported to the FBI at the discretion of the agency.
4.3 Definition of Data Values
A data value is a characteristic of an object (such as the sex of a person) or a parameter of a
data element (such as 2015 – Current Year). For each data element, reporting agencies should
choose the most appropriate data value(s) (i.e., specific characteristics or types of the reported
data that have assigned codes). Although some data values require a specific format, most are
codes from an approved list, each followed by an equal sign (=) and the actual value. For
example, for Data Element 3 (Incident Date), the specific format for the data value is
YYYYMMDDHH. For Data Element 27 (Sex of Victim), agencies may enter one of the codes M =
Male, F = Female, or U = Unknown to describe the gender of the victim; but for Data Element
48 (Sex of Arrestee), agencies may enter only M = Male, F = Female or U = Unknown to describe
the sex of the arrestee.
If more than one of the data values associated with a data element could apply to the situation,
agencies should use the most specific one. For example, in Data Element 9 (Location Type), a
7-Eleven store could be described as 05 = Commercial/Office Building, 07 = Convenience Store,
or 12 = Grocery/Supermarket. Because 07 = Convenience Store is the most specific description,
reporting agencies should use this code.
In some instances, data elements allow for the entry of more than one data value. For example,
Data Element 12 (Type Criminal Activity/Gang Information) allows LEAs to report up to three
types of activity for each offense. If, in a drug case, the offenders grew marijuana and
distributed it by having children sell it at school, the data values of C = Cultivating/
Manufacturing/Publishing, D = Distributing/Selling, and E = Exploiting Children should be
entered.
4.4 Clarification of Specific Data Elements and Data Values
The information in this section provides general explanations of data elements and relates
more to the functional aspect of the UCR Program rather than the technical entry
requirements. LEAs will find the technical aspects for each data element (format, related edits,
and valid data values) in the NIBRS Technical Specification.
Data Element 1 (ORI)
An ORI (Originating Agency Identifier) is a unique nine-character identifier the NCIC has
assigned to each LEA in coordination with the CJIS Systems Officer (CSO). The UCR Program uses
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 94
this identifier to indicate the contributing agency. Data Element 1 is mandatory in each NIBRS
submission.
Data Element 1A (Federal Judicial Districts [JD]) (For Federal Submissions Only)
A Federal Judicial District is a defined legal district that denotes a territory for which a federal
court has jurisdiction. The JD describes what court will hear a federal case. There are currently
95 federal judicial districts across the United States and its territories. This data element in
NIBRS describes where the crime(s) took place by designating what JD the incident occurred. In
NIBRS federal agencies can reflect the incident location as the JD code to give a better
geographical location of the incident.
This data element is mandatory for federal submitters.

Data Element 2 (Incident Number)
An incident number is the number assigned by the reporting agency to each Group A Incident
Report to uniquely identify the incident (e.g., the LEA’s case number). Data Element 2 is
mandatory in each NIBRS submission.
If data from a Group A Incident Report are furnished to outside entities for research purposes,
the FBI will encrypt the incident numbers prior to their dissemination to ensure the recipient
cannot identify the actual case. Agencies may also encrypt their incident numbers before
sending them to the FBI.
Data Element 2A (Cargo Theft)
Data Element 2A indicates whether the incident involved a cargo theft. The FBI’s UCR Program
has defined Cargo Theft as “the criminal taking of any cargo including, but not limited to, goods,
chattels, money, or baggage that constitutes, in whole or in part, a commercial shipment of
freight moving in commerce, from any pipeline system, railroad car, motor truck, or other
vehicle, or from any tank or storage facility, station house, platform, or depot, or from any
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 97
vessel or wharf, or from any aircraft, air terminal, airport, aircraft terminal or air freight station,
warehouse, freight distribution facility, or freight consolidation facility. For purposes of this
definition, cargo shall be deemed as moving in commerce at all points between the point of
origin and the final destination, regardless of any temporary stop while awaiting transshipment
or otherwise.”
Two key phrases in the classification of cargo theft are “commercial shipment” and “in the
supply chain.” For LEAs to classify an incident as a cargo theft, the items must be part of a
commercial shipment and must be in the supply chain (i.e., moving in commerce).
LEAs should consider thefts of goods being delivered to a business from United Parcel Service
(UPS), Federal Express (FedEx), the U.S. Postal Service, etc., to be cargo until the items arrive at
the business, or final distribution point. Once the business receives the items (i.e., personnel at
the company sign for the goods), the goods are no longer considered cargo because they are
outside of the supply chain. Therefore, LEAs should not consider deliveries from UPS, FedEx, to
individuals or other businesses (e.g., flowers, pizza, electronics, appliances, etc.) to be cargo
because they are outside of the supply chain.
Cargo theft-related offenses are:
120 = Robbery
210 = Extortion/Blackmail
220 = Burglary/Breaking and Entering
23D = Theft From Building
23F = Theft From Motor Vehicle
23H = All Other Larceny
240 = Motor Vehicle Theft
26A = False Pretenses/Swindle/Confidence Game
26B = Credit Card/Automated Teller Machine Fraud
26C = Impersonation
26E = Wire Fraud
26F = Identity Theft
26G = Hacking/Computer Invasion
270 = Embezzlement
510 = Bribery
Valid Data Values
Y = Yes
N = No
(Blank) = Not a Cargo Theft offense
Example 1
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 98
Four men wearing ski masks conducted armed robbery at a trucking facility (UCR Offense Code
120 Robbery). Two of the men held the guards at gunpoint while the other two men jumped
into an idling truck nearby and drove off with the cargo.
Example 2
Five suspects entered a slow-moving freight train, which was transporting cargo from the
freight yard to numerous destinations. The suspects used various tools to break into the
shipping containers. The merchandise was then thrown off the train and accomplices on the
ground gathered the stolen merchandise (UCR Offense Code 220 Burglary/Breaking & Entering).
Example 3
A subject used a stolen commercial driver’s license with like characteristics to enter a trucking
company (UCR Offense Code 26F = Identity Theft). After gaining access to the building, the
suspect drove away with the vehicle and the cargo within the trailer (UCR Offense Code 220
Burglary/Breaking and Entering).
Example 4
An unknown subject hacked into a shipping company’s computer system (UCR Offense Code
26G Hacking/Computer Invasion) and redirected the shipment to an alternate location. The
cargo was unlawfully seized, by a group of unknown subjects, from the back of a box truck, on
the docks of the alternate location across town (UCR Offense Code 23F Theft from Motor
Vehicle).
Data Element 3 (Incident Date)
LEAs should use Data Element 3 (Incident Date) to enter the year, month, and day (YYYYMMDD)
when the incident occurred or the beginning of the time period in which it occurred, as
appropriate. This data element also includes the report date indicator (R = Report Date) and the
hour of the incident (00-23). If the Incident Date is unknown, the date of the report with the
indicator R = Report should be entered. If the Incident Hour is unknown, the hour should be left
blank. This data element is mandatory in each NIBRS submission.
If the incident occurred on or between midnight and 0059, 00 should be entered; if on or
between 0100 and 0159, 01 should be entered; if on or between 2300 and 2359, 23 should be
entered; etc. If the incident occurred at exactly midnight, LEAs should consider it occurred at
the beginning of the next day, as if the crime occurred at 1 minute past midnight. Therefore,
LEAs would enter 00 for the hour, along with the next day’s date.
Example 1
If a Robbery occurred at 9:30 p.m. on July 2, 2018, the entry should be 20180702 21.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 99
Example 2
If a Kidnapping started at 11:30 p.m. on November 1, 2018, and ended on November 16, 2018,
the entry should be 20181101 23.
Example 3
If an incident occurred at midnight on December 31, 2017, and January 1, 2018, the entry
should be 20180101 00.
Example 4
If the date and hour of the incident are unknown but the date of the report was
March 15, 2018, the entry should be 20150318R with the R = Report Date entered after the
Report Date.
Data Element 4 (Cleared Exceptionally)
Data Element 4 (Cleared Exceptionally) indicates whether the LEA cleared the incident by
exceptional means. In a multiple-offense incident, the exceptional clearance of one offense
clears the entire incident.
LEAs must not confuse exceptionally clearing an incident with administratively closing an
investigation, and LEAs cannot clear an incident exceptionally if it was previously or is
concurrently cleared by arrest (i.e., if an Arrestee Segment (Level 6) was/is submitted).
Valid Data Values
A = Death of Offender
B = Prosecution Declined (by the prosecutor for other than lack of probable cause)
C = In Custody of Other Jurisdiction (includes extradition denied)
D = Victim Refused to Cooperate (in the prosecution)
E = Juvenile/No Custody (the handling of a juvenile without taking him/her into custody, but
rather by oral or written notice given to the parents or legal guardian in a case involving a
minor offense, such as petty larceny)
N = Not Applicable (not cleared exceptionally)
C = In Custody of Other Jurisdiction
Beginning January 1, 2011, agencies began using data value C = In Custody of Other Jurisdiction
for cases in which extraditions are formally denied or in circumstances where an offender
committed offenses in two jurisdictions and was arrested in one of the jurisdictions. The LEA in
the jurisdiction not reporting the arrest should report this data value when they become aware
of the arrest.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 100
N = Not Applicable
If an incident was not cleared by either an arrest or exceptional means by the time an initial
Group A Incident Report is submitted regarding it, then the agency should enter N = Not
Applicable.
If, after a Group A Incident Report was submitted, an offender was arrested, the agency should
update the previously submitted report with an Arrestee Segment. Submitting an Arrestee
Segment will automatically clear the incident. This data element should still contain
N = Not Applicable.
To clear an offense by exceptional means, LEAs must meet ALL four of the following conditions:
1. The LEA investigation must have clearly and definitely established the identity of at least
one offender.
2. The LEA must have sufficient probable cause to support arresting, charging, and prosecuting
the offender.
3. The LEA must know the exact location of the offender so they could make an arrest if
circumstances did not prevent it.
4. There must be a reason outside the control of the LEA preventing the arrest, charging, and
turning over for prosecution. (i.e., A through E).
Example
A kidnapper, who was holding a hostage, killed himself when the building in which he
barricaded himself was surrounded by the police. The Kidnapping should be reported and
cleared exceptionally by A = Death of Offender.
Data Element 5 (Exceptional Clearance Date)
LEAs use Data Element 5 (Exceptional Clearance Date) to enter the date the incident is cleared
by exceptional means (YYYYMMDD) when data values other than N = Not Applicable are
entered in Data Element 4 (Cleared Exceptionally).
Exceptional Clearance Offense Code
Exceptional Clearance Offense Code is a supplementary data element used to enter the original
incident’s offense(s) to enable identification of the offense(s) the LEA is exceptionally clearing.
LEAs use this data element only when Data Element 4 indicates they are clearing the incident
exceptionally.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 101
Data Element 6 (UCR Offense Code)
Data Element 6 (UCR Offense Code) is used to enter the data values of the ten most serious
Group A offenses occurring in the incident (as determined by the reporting agency). A minimum
of one Offense Segment must be included in a Group A Incident. In addition, LEAs should
submit only one offense for each reported UCR Offense Code even though there may have
been more than one victim of the crime. LEAs can find a complete listing of Group A offenses in
Section 2.3, Group A and Group B Offense Listing.
LEAs must report each offense if it is a separate, distinct crime, rather than just a part of
another offense. For example, because every robbery includes an element of assault, agencies
should report only the offense of Robbery. If during a Robbery, however, the offender forces
the victim to engage in sexual relations, then the LEA should report both Robbery and Rape
because forced sexual intercourse is not an element of robbery.
Note: The robbery/assault example above contains “lesser included” offenses. Mutually
exclusive offenses are offenses that cannot occur to the same victim according to UCR
definitions. Lesser included offenses are offenses where one offense is an element of another
offense and cannot be reported as having happened to the victim along with the other offense.
(For more information about mutually exclusive/lesser included offenses, refer to the NIBRS
Technical Specification, Data Element 24 [Victim Connected to UCR Offense Code]).
Data Element 7 (Offense Attempted/Completed/Unfounded)
LEAs should use Data Element 7 (Offense Attempted/Completed/Unfounded) to indicate
whether each offense in the incident was attempted/completed/Unfounded. When an offense
occurs more than once within an incident and one of the instances was completed, then LEAs
should consider all of the instances of the offense completed.
Note: Attempted Murder should be reported as Aggravated Assault, and all Assault offenses
should be coded as C = Completed.
Valid Data Values
A = Attempted
C = Completed
U= Unfounded
Data Element 8 (Offender Suspected of Using)
LEAs should use Data Element 8 (Offender Suspected of Using) to indicate whether any of the
offenders in the incident were suspected of consuming alcohol or using drugs/narcotics during
or shortly before the incident, or using computer equipment to perpetrate the crime. LEAs can
enter up to three types of activity per offense type in Data Element 8.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 102
Valid Data Values
A = Alcohol
C = Computer Equipment (Handheld Devices)
D = Drugs/Narcotics
N = Not Applicable (Mutually Exclusive)
R= Drone/Unmanned Aircraft system
Example
A driver swerved out of her lane into oncoming traffic, striking another vehicle. A passing
motorist stopped and called 911. The responding officer asked the driver at fault why she
swerved into the other lane; she had no recollection of why she swerved into oncoming traffic.
One of the passengers in the other vehicle passed away at the scene due to the injuries
sustained during the crash. The officer observed the driver at fault, talking and texting on her
cell phone at the scene. He asked the driver if she had a hands-free device and the driver
responded “no” to this question.
The officer obtained the phone records of the driver and found a series of texts were sent and
received immediately prior to the accident. The driver was arrested for negligent manslaughter
due to driving distracted while using a cell/smartphone. In Data Element 8 (Offender Suspected
of Using), data value C = Computer Equipment (Handheld Devices) should be scored.
Example
A police officer is stationed on the highway in a location known for speeding. He measures a
vehicle traveling 12 mph an hour over the posted limit and attempts to pull the vehicle over.
The vehicle attempts to evade the officer, increasing its speed and passing other vehicles on the
left and right, including driving on the shoulder of the road. During the pursuit, several vehicles
attempting to enter the highway were required to pull off onto the shoulder to avoid striking
the evading vehicle. During the pursuit, the vehicle exceeds 100 mph, which is 30 miles over the
speed limit. The pursuit ended in a crash with another vehicle killing the driver in that vehicle.
The crash is assessed to be the fault of the evading vehicle. The evading driver was injured but
survived and was subsequently charged with Negligent Manslaughter as a result of reckless
driving. The data value reported in Data Element 8 (Offender Suspected of Using), should be N =
Not Applicable (Mutually Exclusive).
Data Element 8A (Bias Motivation)
Data Element 8A (Bias Motivation) is used to indicate whether an offense was motivated by the
offender’s bias and, if so, what type of bias. LEAs can enter up to five bias motivations per
offense type.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 103
Because of the difficulty of ascertaining the offender’s subjective motivation, LEAs should
report a bias motivation only if investigation reveals sufficient objective facts to lead a
reasonable and prudent person to conclude the offender’s actions were motivated, in whole or
in part, by bias against race/ethnicity/ancestry, religion, disability, gender, gender identity, or
sexual orientation.
Unless the bias for a hate crime falls into one of the FBI’s UCR Program bias categories, an
agency should report zero hate crime data. LEAs should report zero hate crime data as data
value 88 = None. In NIBRS, incidents not involving any facts indicating bias motivation on the
part of the offender are to be reported as 88 = None, whereas incidents involving ambiguous
facts (some facts are present but are not conclusive) should be reported as data value
99 = Unknown. When an offense is initially classified as bias motivation 99 = Unknown and
subsequent investigation reveals the crime was motivated by bias or no bias was found, the
agency must update its original submission.
Valid Data Values
Bias Categories
Race / Ethnicity / Ancestry
11 = Anti-White
12 = Anti-Black or African American
13 = Anti-American Indian or Alaska Native
14 = Anti-Asian

Example 1
While driving through a predominantly white neighborhood, a black male stopped his car to
repair a flat tire. A group of white males leaving a bar across the street accosted the driver and
then attacked him with bottles and clubs. During the attack, the offenders called the victim by a
well-known and recognized epithet used against blacks and told him blacks were not welcome
in the neighborhood.
Offense - Aggravated Assault. This incident should be reported with an Anti-Black or African
American Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry bias because the victim and offenders were of different
races; the offenders used a racial epithet; and the facts reveal no other reason for the attack
than the stated one: the offenders’ desire to keep blacks out of the neighborhood.
Example 2
A group home for persons with psychiatric disabilities who were in transition back into the
community was the site of a reported arson. Investigation revealed that neighbors had
expressed many concerns about the group home in town meetings and were angry that the
house was located in their community. Shortly before the fire was reported, a witness heard a
man state, “I’ll get rid of those ‘crazies,’ I’ll burn them out.” Twelve persons, including patients
and staff, suffered second- and third-degree burns resulting from the Arson.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 105
Offenses - Aggravated Assault (12 victims) and Arson (1 Arson). An Anti-Mental Disability bias
should be reported with this incident since the suspect apparently committed the crime due to
his bias against persons with psychiatric disabilities.
Example 3
A juvenile male snatched a Jewish woman’s purse, and in doing so, knocked her down and
called her by a well-known and recognized epithet used against Jews. The offender’s identity is
not known. Although the offender used an epithet for Jews, it is not known whether he belongs
to another religious group or whether his motive was anything more than Robbery.
Offense - Robbery. Because the facts are ambiguous, agencies should not report this incident as
bias-motivated unless the investigation positively concludes that the offender’s bias was a
contributing factor in the crime. The offense should be reported as 99 = Unknown. Should an
offender be arrested, subsequent investigation would determine whether or not the offense
was bias motivated. The offense should then be reported as either 88 = None or the code for
the appropriate bias motivation.
Example 4
Overnight, unknown person(s) broke into a synagogue and destroyed several priceless religious
objects. The perpetrators painted a large red swastika on the door and wrote “Death to Jews”
on a wall. Although other valuable items were present, none were stolen.
Offenses - Burglary and Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property. This incident should be
reported with an Anti-Jewish religious bias because the offender(s) destroyed priceless religious
objects and left anti-Semitic words and graffiti behind, and theft did not appear to be the
motive for the burglary.
Example 5
In a parking lot next to a bar, a 29-year-old Japanese-American male was attacked by a 51-year
old white male wielding a tire iron. The victim suffered severe lacerations and a broken arm.
Investigation revealed that the offender and victim had previously exchanged racial insults in
the bar. The offender initiated the exchange by calling the victim by a well-known epithet used
against the Japanese and complained that the Japanese were taking jobs away from Americans.
Offense - Aggravated Assault. An Anti-Asian Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry bias should be reported
with this incident based on the difference in race of the victim and offender, the exchange of
racial insults, and the absence of other reasons for the attack.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 106
Example 6
Someone threw a rock breaking a window in a Syrian-owned convenience store. The store had
signs written in Arabic displayed in the window and outside the store. The rock, which had a
disparaging message about the owner’s Arab ancestry, struck the owner in the head, which
caused a gash requiring medical attention.
Offenses - Aggravated assault and Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property. This incident
should be reported with an Anti-Arab Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry Bias since the evidence indicates
the victim was targeted due to his ancestral descent.
Example 7
A street gang assaulted three Hindu men while shouting a well-known Hindu epithet. The gang
beat them so severely each suffered a coma.
Offense - Aggravated Assault (3 victims). This incident should be reported with an Anti-Hindu
Religious Bias because the evidence indicates the victims were targeted due to their religious
affiliation.
Example 8
An assailant ran by a Sikh pedestrian, shoved him to the ground, forcibly pulled his Dastaar
(Sikh turban) and said, “Take that thing off your head–we don’t want your kind in the
neighborhood!” In the process of the attack, the victim suffered a concussion. When a law
enforcement responded to the scene, a witness to the attack recognized the offender as a clerk
at a local convenience store near a predominantly Sikh community.
Offense - Aggravated Assault. This incident should be reported with an Anti-Sikh Religious Bias
because the evidence indicates the victim was targeted due to his Dastaar and the assailant’s
ongoing dealings with the Sikh community. Data Element 9 (Location Type).
Data Element 9 (Location Type)
LEAs should use Data Element 9 (Location Type) to report the type of location/premises where
each offense in an incident took place.
The FBI’s UCR Program recognizes that for many incidents, there is more than one possible
choice for reporting a location. Therefore, LE personnel should use their best judgment in
reporting the most specific location type after investigating the crime and considering the
circumstances surrounding the location and the offender’s intent during the commission of the
crime.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 107
Because the geographic location of an incident is not always the same as the functional location
of the incident, the FBI’s UCR Program relies on LEAs to report the most appropriate location
type. For example, if an offense occurs at an elementary school playground during school
hours, the location can be classified as 53 = School – Elementary/Secondary. But, if the offense
occurred at the same physical location on a Saturday afternoon when the school is not
operating and the public are allowed to use the facility for recreational purposes, LEAs would
be equally correct in classifying the location as 50 = Park/Playground.
Sometimes, LEAs can determine the location by the offender’s intent during the commission of
the crime. For example, if the offender chose to commit a robbery during a church service held
at a public facility routinely used for basketball games, LEAs can choose to classify the location
as 04 = Church/Synagogue/Temple/Mosque since the building was being used for a public
religious activity at the time the crime was committed.

families; venues set up as temporary
shelters (e.g., a shelter set up in a church or
school during a storm)
55 = Shopping Mall indoor or outdoor shopping areas and/or
centers with multiple (two or more) stores
and/or businesses; strip malls
Note: LEAs should use the data value that
best describes the location in question.
56 = Tribal Lands Native American reservations, communities,
and/or trust lands
Note: The FBI’s UCR Program intends that
non-tribal LEAs will primarily use this data
value. Tribal agencies should use the data
value that best describes the location in
question.
57 = Community Center public locations where members of a
community gather for group activities, social
activities, public information, and other
purposes; they may sometimes be open for
the whole community or for a specialized
group within the greater community;
Christian community center; Islamic
community center; Jewish community
center; youth clubs, etc.
58 = Cyberspace a virtual or internet-based network of two
or more computers in separate locations
which communicate either through wireless
or wire connections.
Example 1
Police received a phone call from an individual who reported he recently received a letter from
a local business informing him the business’ computers were recently hacked from an external
source and the customer’s personal information might have been compromised. The individual
then reported he noticed someone had opened credit cards and other loans in his name. The
agency should enter data value 26F = Identity Theft into Data Element 6 (UCR Offense Code),
since the individual’s personal information had been taken from the victim business and new
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 112
accounts had been opened in the individual’s name. Because the data was obtained by the
perpetrator through the use of the internet, data value 58 = Cyberspace should be entered into
Data Element 9 (Location Type). Had the internet not been available, then this crime could not
have been committed in the matter upon which it occurred.
Example 2
Police received a phone call from an individual who reported he recently received a letter from
the Target Corporation, informing him that the business’ computers were recently stolen and
the customer’s personal information may have been compromised. The individual then
reported he noticed someone had opened credit cards and other loans in his name. The agency
should enter data value 26F = Identity Theft into Data Element 6 (UCR Offense Code), since the
individual’s personal information had been taken from the victim business and new accounts
had been opened in the individual’s name. Data value 08 = Department/Discount Store should
be entered into Data Element 9 (Location Type), since this incident is not cyberspace related.
The fact the internet exists has nothing to do with the commission of this crime.
Example 3
Police received a phone call from a business that reported their computers were recently
hacked based on information identified by its information technology staff. The business
reported the hacking/invasion offense appeared to have come from an internet address located
in Iran. The LEA should enter data value 26G = Hacking/Computer Invasion into Data Element 6
(UCR Offense Code). Data value 58 = Cyberspace should be entered into Data Element 9
(Location Type) because this crime could not have been committed if cyberspace had not been
available.
Example 4
Police received a phone call from a business that stated an employee had used his computer to
download and steal trade secret information from the company. The company stated the
individual did not have access to the information and fraudulently accessed the folders where
the information was located. The LEA should enter data value 26G = Hacking/Computer
Invasion into Data Element 6 (UCR Offense Code). Data value 05 = Commercial/Office Building
should be entered into Data Element 9 (Location Type). This incident is not cyberspace related.
Even though a computer was used to steal the information, the subject used an internal system
and could have directly accessed the information without using the Internet.
Data Element 10 (Number of Premises Entered)
LEAs should use Data Element 10 (Number of Premises Entered) only if the crime is
Burglary/Breaking and Entering and the Hotel Rule applies (see the offense of
220 = Burglary/Breaking and Entering for more information about the Hotel Rule). In such
cases, the number of structures (premises) entered should be reported.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 113
In NIBRS, the Hotel Rule includes rental storage facilities such as mini-storage and self-storage
buildings. Therefore, this data element is used if the offense is 220 = Burglary/Breaking and
Entering and either data value 14 = Hotel/Motel/Etc. or data value 19 = Rental Storage Facility
is entered into Data Element 9 (Location Type). The total number (up to 99) of individual rooms,
units, suites, storage compartments, etc. entered should then be reported in this data element
(01-99).
Example 1
A burglar forcibly entered 11 rented storage compartments in a self-storage building. The
owner/manager of the building reported the incident to the police. The police department
should then enter data values 220 = Burglary/Breaking and Entering into Data Element 6 (UCR
Offense Code), 19 = Rental Storage Facility into Data Element 9 (Location Type), and the
number 11 (for 11 compartments) into this data element.
Example 2
When an LEA investigates a burglary at a private residence, the agency should enter data value
220 = Burglary/Breaking and Entering into Data Element 6 (UCR Offense Code) and data value
20 = Residence/Home into Data Element 9 (Location Type). However, because the Location
Type was not 14 = Hotel/Motel/Etc. or 19 = Rental Storage Facility, no entry should be made
into this data element. It should be blank.
Data Element 11 (Method of Entry)
Data Element 11 (Method of Entry) should be used only if the offense is 220 =
Burglary/Breaking and Entering. LEAs should use it to report whether the burglar(s) used force
or no force to enter the structure. A forced entry is where the burglar used force of any degree
or a mechanical contrivance of any kind (including a passkey or skeleton key) to unlawfully
enter a building or other structure. Agencies should also include burglary by concealment inside
a building followed by exiting the structure as forced entry. An unforced entry is one where the
burglar unlawfully entered through an unlocked door or window, but used no force. If both
forced and unforced entries were involved in the crime, the entry should be reported as
F = Force since the entry was accomplished through the use of force.
Valid Data Values
F = Force
N = No Force
Example
An investigation of a burglary complaint disclosed the offender(s) entered the building through
an unlocked street door and then forced a locked door to an office and stole a laptop. Since one
door was forced, F = Force should be entered.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 114
Data Element 12 (Type Criminal Activity/Gang Information)
Data Element 12 (Type Criminal Activity/Gang Information) indicates the criminal activity/gang
involvement of the offenders for certain offenses, including Animal Cruelty.
Criminal Activity
Agencies must report the type of criminal activity of offenders in incidents involving the
following offenses:
250 = Counterfeiting/Forgery
280 = Stolen Property Offenses
30C = Smuggling Illegal Aliens*
35A = Drug/Narcotic Violations
35B = Drug Equipment Violations
39C = Gambling Equipment Violations
370 = Pornography/Obscene Material
49A = Harboring Escapee/Concealing Arrest*
520 = Weapon Law Violations
521 = Violation of National Firearms Act of 1934*
522 = Weapons of Mass Destruction*
526 = Explosives*
58A = Import Violations*
58B = Export Violations*
61A = Federal Liquor Violations*
61B = Federal Tobacco Violations*
620 = Wildlife Trafficking*
720 = Animal Cruelty
*Denotes offenses for federal and tribal LEA reporting only
Valid Data Values (Criminal Activity)
LEAs may enter up to three types of activity for each offense above:
A = Simple/Gross neglect (unintentionally, intentionally, or knowingly failing to provide food,
water, shelter, veterinary care, hoarding, etc.)
B = Buying/Receiving
C = Cultivating
D = Distributing/Selling
E = Exploiting Children
F = Organized Abuse (Dog Fighting and Cock Fighting)
I = Intentional Abuse and Torture (tormenting, mutilating, maiming, poisoning, or
abandonment)
O = Operating/Promoting/ Assisting/Abetting
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 115
P = Possessing/Concealing
R = Stolen Firearm
S = Animal Sexual Abuse (Bestiality)
T = Transporting/Transmitting/Importing
U = Using/Consuming
W = Conspiracy
Example 1
The offenders published and sold pornographic photographs of children. Because up to three
types of activity may be entered, the agency should enter C = Cultivating/Manufacturing/
Publishing, D = Distributing/ Selling, and E = Exploiting Children.
Example 2
Police received a telephone complaint from a person whose neighbor was leaving her dog
outside in extreme heat without food or water daily. Police responded to the call and found a
German Shepherd that was breathing heavily and appeared to be very thin. Police contacted
the owner of the dog, who denied the allegations. Police arrested the dog’s owner and charged
her with Animal Cruelty. The agency should enter the criminal activity as 720 = Animal Cruelty
with a data value of A = Simple/Gross Neglect.
Example 3
Police received a 911 call about someone shooting squirrels. The police respond to the call and
find a squirrel lying in the road with a gunshot wound. Police identify the shooter, squirrel
season is underway, and the shooter has a valid hunting license and is NOT breaking any other
laws. The act of hunting is not considered to be animal cruelty, therefore no offense should be
reported, provided the hunting location is legal.
Example 4
An undercover law enforcement investigation uncovers a dog-fighting contest that occurs every
Saturday evening in a local community. The following week, law enforcement officers show up
at the contest with a warrant and make numerous arrests. The agency should report data value
720 = Animal Cruelty into Data Element 12 (Type Criminal Activity/Gang Information). Data
values F = Organized Abuse and I = Intentional Abuse or Torture (tormenting, mutilating,
maiming, poisoning, or abandonment) should be entered for the type of criminal activity.
Gang Information
Also, LEAs should use this data element to describe the type, or lack of presence, of an
offender’s gang activity for incidents involving the following offenses:
09A = Murder and Nonnegligent Manslaughter
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 116
09B = Negligent Manslaughter
100 = Kidnapping/Abduction
11A = Rape
11B = Sodomy
11C = Sexual Assault With An Object
11D = Criminal Sexual Contact
120 = Robbery
13A = Aggravated Assault
13B = Simple Assault
13C = Intimidation
210 = Extortion/Blackmail
Valid Data Values (Gang Information)
LEAs should enter up to two gang information codes for each offense above:
J = Juvenile Gang (membership is predominantly juvenile [under 18 years of age])
G = Other Gang (membership is predominantly 18 years of age or older)
N = None/Unknown (Mutually Exclusive with the value of J and G only)
For NIBRS reporting purposes, a gang is an ongoing organization, association, or group of three
or more persons who have a common interest and/or activity characterized by the commission
of or involvement in a pattern of criminal or delinquent conduct. If an agency establishes gang
involvement with any of the offenses above, the agency should use the predominant age of the
associated gang’s membership (and not the offender’s age) to determine whether
J = Juvenile Gang or G = Other Gang should be entered.
Juvenile Gang refers to a group of persons who go about together or act in concert, especially
for antisocial or criminal purposes; typically, adolescent members have common identifying
signs and symbols, such as hand signals and distinctive colors; they are also known as street
gangs.
Other Gang refers to persons associated with the world of criminal gangs and organized crime
commonly related to widespread criminal activities coordinated and controlled through a
central syndicate and who rely on their unlawful activities for income; they traditionally extort
money from businesses by intimidation, violence, or other illegal methods.
Example 5
Two females, aged 19, were riding bicycles through a neighborhood. Three males approached
them and forced them to stop. They exchanged words and one of the males attacked the
bicyclists. Each of the three attackers, one, aged 16, and the other two, aged 17, had identical
tattoos on their upper right arm. This marking was commonly associated with a local gang. The
NIBRS entry should be J = Juvenile Gang.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 117
Data Element 13 (Type Weapon/Force Involved)
In Data Element 13, LEAs can indicate up to three types of weapons or force used by the
offender in incidents involving the following offenses:

09B = Negligent Manslaughter
09C = Justifiable Homicide
100 = Kidnapping/Abduction
11A = Rape
11B = Sodomy

522 = Weapons of Mass Destruction*
526 = Explosives*
64A = Human Trafficking, Commercial Sex Acts
64B = Human Trafficking, Involuntary Servitude
*Denotes offenses for federal and tribal LEA reporting only
When reporting the weapons used, select the most specific weapon type listed, e.g., LEAs
should report a revolver as Handgun rather than Firearm. If a weapon was used that could be
employed in several ways, choose the weapon type that indicates how the weapon was used.
For example, if the offender used a bottle in the commission of a murder, report Blunt Object if
the victim was beaten or Knife/Cutting Instrument if the offender cut or stabbed the victim with
the bottle.
The FBI’s UCR Program defines an automatic firearm as any firearm that shoots, or is designed
to shoot, more than one shot at a time by a single pull of the trigger without manual reloading.
If the weapon was an automatic firearm, LEAs should add an A as a suffix to its weapon data
value, e.g., 13A = Automatic Rifle. Do NOT include semi-automatic as an automatic weapon.
As a result of the APB recommendation to collect Vehicular Manslaughter offenses as Negligent
Manslaughter, “/Vessel” was added to the end of data value 35 = Motor Vehicle.
The APB recommended adding "deadly diseases" to the current list of examples included within Data
Value 90 (Other) to provide clear guidance on which weapon type to report when investigation has
determined the offender is aware he/she is infected with a deadly disease and deliberately inflicts or
attempts to inflict the disease on another person.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 118
Examples include an offender coughing and spitting while threatening to infect another person with
a deadly disease or an offender raping an individual with the intent to infect the victim with a deadly
disease.
Valid Data Values
11 = Firearm
12 = Handgun
13 = Rifle
14 = Shotgun
15 = Other Firearm
20 = Knife/Cutting Instrument (knives, razors, hatchets, axes, cleavers, scissors, glass, broken

70 = Drugs/Narcotics/Sleeping Pills
85 = Asphyxiation
90 = Other (BB guns, pellet guns, Tasers, pepper spray, stun guns, deadly/ dangerous/
communicable diseases, etc.)
95 = Unknown
99 = None (Mutually Exclusive)
Example 1
Three robbers held up a bank. One offender brandished a revolver, the second had a sawed-off
shotgun, and the third had an automatic machine gun. The weapon data values should be
12 = Handgun, 14 = Shotgun, and 15A = Automatic Other Firearm.
Example 2
The driver of one boat struck another boat while on a lake. The driver was determined to be
intoxicated after failing a battery of field sobriety tests. A passenger in the other boat died as a
result of the injuries sustained in the crash. As a result, the driver at fault was charged with
Negligent Manslaughter. The weapon data value should be 35 = Motor Vehicle/Vessel.
Data Element 14 (Type Property Loss/Etc.)
Agencies should use Data Element 14 to describe the type(s) of property loss, recovery, seizure,
etc., that occurred in an incident. LEAs should report separate property information for each
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 119
type of loss/etc., when the incident involved Kidnapping/Abduction, Crimes Against Property,
Drug/Narcotic Offenses, and Gambling Offenses.
An agency should report property stolen in its jurisdiction only. Likewise, only the agency that
reported the property stolen can report the property recovered even if another jurisdiction
recovered the property.
Valid Data Values
LEAs should enter one for each type of property loss:
1 = None
2 = Burned (includes damage caused in fighting the fire)
3 = Counterfeited/Forged
4 = Destroyed/Damaged/Vandalized
5 = Recovered (to impound property that was previously stolen)
6 = Seized (to impound property that was not previously stolen)
7 = Stolen/Etc. (includes bribed, defrauded, embezzled, extorted, ransomed, robbed, etc.)
8 = Unknown
Example 1
For Arson, the entries could be 1 = None (an attempt with no property burned), 2 = Burned
(property burned), or 8 = Unknown (not known whether property burned).
Example 2
For burglary, the entries could be 1 = None (an attempted burglary or the structure was
entered but no property was taken), 7 = Stolen/Etc. (property was taken),
5 = Recovered (stolen property was recovered), or 8 = Unknown (it is not known whether
property was taken).
Example 3
If the same incident involved both Arson and Burglary, the choices of property loss/etc. codes
shown in Examples 1 and 2 would apply depending on the circumstances.
Data Element 15 (Property Description)
LEAs should use Data Element 15 to report descriptions of the property that was burned,
counterfeited/forged, destroyed/damaged/vandalized, recovered, seized, stolen, bribed,
defrauded, embezzled, extorted, ransomed, robbed, etc., as a result of the incident. LEAs can
report up to ten property descriptions per type of property loss, etc. If more than ten types of
property are involved, the nine most valuable should be specified with property description
codes and the remaining properties combined and coded as 77 = Other.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 120
The UCR Program realizes there may be more than one possible choice to describe property. LE
personnel should use their best judgment in reporting the property description after
investigating the crime and considering the circumstances surrounding the crime and the use of
the property during the commission of the crime.
For example, full-size vans, both regular wheelbase and extended wheelbase, may be classified
as either 05 = Buses, 28 = Recreational Vehicles, or 37 = Trucks depending on the vehicle
configuration, i.e., vans with rows of seats (05 = Buses), custom vans with temporary lodging
accommodations (28 = Recreational Vehicles), or work vans with primarily cargo areas
(37 = Trucks).

88 = Pending Inventory items whose property description is
unknown until the LEA conducts an
inventory
Example 1
If a house was destroyed by arson and the homeowners were away on an overseas trip, making
it impossible to determine the property loss until their return, the agency should enter
88 = Pending Inventory.
Note: LEAs should update the property information with entries describing the type(s) of
burned property when the results of the inventory are subsequently determined.
Example 2
The following property was stolen as the result of a burglary: (1) a $10,000 stamp collection,
(2) jewelry worth $5,000, (3) an $1,800 personal computer, (4) clothes worth $1,500, (5)
silverware worth $800, (6) a $650 TV, (7) $450 in stereo equipment, (8) a $400 microwave
oven, (9) $350 in cash, (10) a $250 copier (11) a $150 shotgun, (12) a $100 bicycle, (13) two
credit cards (no value), and (14) ten blank personal checks (no value).
The stamp collection should be coded as 46 = Collections/Collectibles. The jewelry and
silverware should be entered as code 17 = Jewelry/Precious Metals/Gems, the personal
computer as 07 = Computer Hardware/Software, the clothes as 06 = Clothes/Furs, the TV and
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 132
stereo equipment as 26 = Radios/TVs/VCRs/DVD Players, the microwave oven as 16 =
Household Goods, the cash as 20 = Money, the copier as 23 = Office-type Equipment, and the
shotgun as 13 = Firearms. Because more than ten items were taken, the bicycle, the two credit
cards, and the ten blank personal checks should be coded as 77 = Other.
Data Element 16 (Value of Property)
Agencies should use Data Element 16 (Value of Property) to enter the total dollar value (in
whole dollars) of the property burned (including damage caused in fighting the fire),
counterfeited, destroyed/damaged/vandalized, recovered, seized, stolen, etc., as a result of an
incident.
LEAs can enter up to ten values to match the up to ten property descriptions (Data Element 15)
associated with each Property Segment (i.e., each type of property loss/etc.) in the incident. If
more than ten types of property are involved, the values of the nine most valuable, coded
properties should be entered; then, the total value of the remaining properties combined which
were coded as 77 = Other in Data Element 15 should be combined and then entered.
If the value of a property is unknown, the agency should enter the value one dollar ($1), which
means unknown.
An agency should report only the value of the property stolen in its jurisdiction. Likewise, the
agency that originally reported the property stolen should report the value of the property as
recovered, regardless of whether another agency recovered the property. This procedure
applies to all stolen property, including motor vehicles. (Some agencies find it valuable to
maintain separate records on property they recover for other jurisdictions.)
The valid data values to be used in Data Element 16 (Value of Property) are 1 – 999,999,999;
1 = Unknown, i.e., 000000001, should be entered.
Additional Considerations
When LEAs seize drugs or narcotics in a drug case, they should report no value for this data
element, but should report the estimated quantity of the drugs or narcotics. Therefore, when
the offense is 35A = Drug/Narcotic Violations, the data value of 6 = Seized should be entered
into Data Element 14 (Type Property Loss/Etc.) and 10 = Drugs/Narcotics should be entered into
Data Element 15 (Property Description). The agency should enter no value into this data
element; instead, agencies should use Data Element 20 (Suspected Drug Type), Data Element
21 (Estimated Drug Quantity), and Data Element 22 (Type Drug Measurement).
When drugs or narcotics are involved in other types of crime (e.g., they were stolen through
burglary, robbery, theft, etc., or destroyed by arson) their value should be entered into this
data element, and Data Elements 20, 21, and 22 should be left blank.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 133
Guidelines for Property Valuation
Questions frequently arise as to how to valuate property involved in a criminal incident. The
FBI’s UCR Program suggests the following guidelines:
1. Round values to the nearest whole dollar.
2. Use the fair market value for articles subject to depreciation because of wear and tear, age,
or other factors causing the value to decrease with use.
3. Use the victim’s valuation (in most instances) of items such as jewelry, watches, and other
similar goods that decrease in value slightly or not at all with use or age.
4. Use replacement cost or actual cash cost to victim for new or almost new clothes, auto
accessories, bicycles, etc.
5. Use the current market price at the time of the theft, seizure, etc. for negotiable
instruments such as bonds payable to the bearer, etc.
6. Score the theft of non-negotiable instruments such as traveler’s checks, personal checks,
money orders, stocks, bonds, food stamps, etc., but do not record a value.
7. Use the cost to the merchant (wholesale cost) of goods recovered, seized, stolen, etc., from
retail establishments, warehouses, etc. In other words, use the dollar value representing
the actual cash loss to the victim without any markup or profit added.
8. When the victim obviously exaggerates the value of stolen/destroyed/damaged property
for insurance or other purposes, LEAs should use common sense and good judgment to
determine the value reported for the stolen items.
9. Often the condition of the property is different at recovery than it was when stolen. LEAs
should use the market value at the time of recovery even though it is less than the value
reported at the time of the theft. If the value has increased by the time LE recovers the
property, the recovery value should not exceed its initial stolen value. Hair-splitting
refinements are unnecessary.
Note: LEAs may use any type of resource to determine the value of property including the
Internet, Craigslist, eBay, Kelley Blue Book, etc.
Example 1
Two bicycles belonging to two victims were stolen at the same time and place—one was worth
$300 and the other $150. The agency should enter a data value of 04 = Bicycles Data Element
15 (Property Description) and the total value of the bicycles, 450 ($300 + $150 = $450) into Data
Element 16 (Value of Property).
Example 2
The following property was stolen as the result of a burglary: (1) a $10,000 stamp collection,
(2) jewelry worth $5,000, (3) an $1,800 personal computer, (4) clothes worth $1,500, (5)
silverware worth $800, (6) a $650 TV, (7) $450 in stereo equipment, (8) a $400 microwave
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 134
oven, (9) $350 in cash, (10) a $250 copier (11) a $150 shotgun, (12) a $100 bicycle, (13) two
credit cards (no value), and (14) ten blank personal checks (no value).
The values for each specifically coded property should be: $10,000 for data value 46 (the stamp
collection), $5,800 for data value 17 (the jewelry and silverware), $1,800 for data value 07 (the
personal computer), $1,500 for data value 06 (the clothes), $1,100 for data value 26 (the TV
and stereo equipment), $400 for data value 16 (the microwave oven), $350 for data value 20
(the cash), $250 for data value 23 (the copier), and $150 for data value 13 (the shotgun).
Because more than ten items were taken, the value of the bicycle, the two credit cards, and the
ten blank personal checks should be combined and their value ($100) entered under data value
77 = Other.
Data Element 17 (Date Recovered)
If an LEA recovers property previously stolen in their jurisdiction, they should report the month,
day, and year of its recovery in Data Element 17. Accordingly, this data element should be used
only if data value 5 = Recovered is entered into Data Element 14 (Type Property Loss/Etc.). If
the recovery date is unknown, enter the date of the report.
LEAs may report up to ten dates of recovery to match each of the up to ten property
descriptions associated with each type of property loss/etc. in the incident. If there is more
than one date of recovery for the same Property Description, the agency should report the
earliest date.
Note: LEAs should report recovered property only if they also first reported the property stolen.
Example
On March 28, 2018, a thief stole three cars from a used car lot. An LEA recovered one of the
cars on April 1, 2018. On April 24, 2018, they recovered a second car. The date reported for this
data element should be 20180401.
Data Element 18 (Number of Stolen Motor Vehicles)
LEAs should use Data Element 18 to report the number of motor vehicles that were stolen in a
Motor Vehicle Theft incident. Agencies should use this data element only if the offense is 240 =
Motor Vehicle Theft, 7 = Stolen was entered into Data Element 14 (Type Property Loss/Etc.),
and 03 = Automobiles, 05 = Buses, 24 = Other Motor Vehicles, 28 = Recreational Vehicles, or 37
= Trucks was entered into Data Element 15 (Property Description). If the number of vehicles
stolen is unknown, the agency should enter 00 = Unknown. LEAs should not report motor
vehicles taken as the proceeds of other offenses (e.g., Burglary, Fraud, Embezzlement, etc.) In
NIBRS, agencies may report up to 99 vehicles stolen per incident.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 135
Data Element 19 (Number of Recovered Motor Vehicles)
Data Element 19 indicates how many motor vehicles an LEA recovered in a motor vehicle theft
incident. Agencies should use this data element only if the offense is 240 = Motor Vehicle Theft,
5 = Recovered was entered into Data Element 14 (Type Property Loss/Etc.), and
03 = Automobiles, 05 = Buses, 24 = Other Motor Vehicles, 28 = Recreational Vehicles, or
37 = Trucks was entered into Data Element 15 (Property Description). If the number of
recovered vehicles is unknown, the agency should report 00 = Unknown. The agency should not
report motor vehicles recovered as the proceeds of other offenses, i.e., Burglary, Fraud,
Embezzlement, etc. In NIBRS, agencies can report up to 99 vehicles recovered per incident.
Data Element 20 (Suspected Drug Type)
Data Element 20 identifies the types of drugs or narcotics the LEA seized in a drug case.
Agencies should use this data element in the following two instances: (1) one of the offenses in
the incident was 35A = Drug/Narcotic Violations, 6 = Seized was entered into Data Element 14
(Type Property Loss/Etc.), and data value 10 = Drugs/Narcotics was entered into Data Element
15 (Property Description); or (2) one of the offenses is 35A = Drug/Narcotic Violations and
1 = None is entered in Data Element 14 (Type Property Loss/Etc.). This applies to drugs the
offenders flushed down a toilet, swallowed, or the LEA used as part of an undercover
investigation.
LEAs can report up to three types of drugs or narcotics per incident. If more than three are
involved, the two most important (as determined by the reporting agency taking into account
the quantity, value, and deadliness of the drugs or narcotics) should be reported under their
applicable drug types and the remaining drugs or narcotics should be entered as a single
X = Over 3 Drug Types entry.
LEAs should not use this data element when they find drugs or narcotics burned, stolen, etc., in
connection with other offenses, such as arson, burglary/breaking and entering, or larceny/theft.
Valid Data Values
LEAs should enter up to three drug types per incident:
A = Crack Cocaine
B = Cocaine (all forms except Crack)
C = Hashish
D = Heroin
E = Marijuana
F = Morphine
G = Opium
H = Other Narcotics: Codeine; Demerol; Dihydromorphinone or Dilaudid; Hydrocodone or
Percodan; Methadone; Pentazocine; Propoxyphene or Darvon; etc.
I = LSD
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 136
J = PCP
K = Other Hallucinogens: BMDA or White Acid; DMT; MDA; MDMA; Mescaline or Peyote;
Psilocybin; STP; Spice; Dronabinol or Marinol; etc.
L = Amphetamines/Methamphetamines (includes Methcathinone)
M = Other Stimulants: Adipex, Fastine, and Ionamin (Derivatives of Phentermine); Benzedrine;
Didrex; Khat; Bath Salts; Methylphenidate or Ritalin; Phenmetrazine or Preludin; Tenuate;
etc.
N = Barbiturates
O = Other Depressants: Glutethimide or Doriden, Methaqualone or Quaalude, or Talwin; etc.
P = Other Drugs: Antidepressants (Elavil, Triavil, Tofranil, etc.); Aromatic Hydrocarbons;
Tranquilizers (Chlordiazepoxide or Librium, Diazepam or Valium, etc.); Steroids; etc.
U = Unknown Type Drug
X = Over 3 Drug Types
Note: Only agencies in jurisdictions where the possession of Spice, also known as K2, is illegal
should report offenses and/or arrests for the drug. Spice is a synthetic, cannabinoid herbal
substance that, when smoked, produces a Marijuana-like high. However, agencies should not
classify Spice as Marijuana for crime reporting purposes. Because it has been known to cause
hallucinations in some users, the Chemical Unit at the FBI Laboratory has advised that agencies
should report the drugs as K = Other Hallucinogens.
Example
In a drug case, an LEA seized the following drugs: (1) 1.5 kilograms of Crack, (2) 2.125 pounds
of Marijuana, (3) 2.0 liquid ounces of Morphine, and (4) 500 Valium capsules. The agency
should enter A = Crack Cocaine, E = Marijuana, and X = Over 3 Drug Types as a single entry for
the Morphine and Valium because more than three types of drugs were seized.
Note: When more than three types of drugs are involved, the two most important drugs (as
determined by the reporting agency based on the quantity, value, and deadliness of the
drugs/narcotics) should be reported in Drug Type 1 and Drug Type 2; X = Over 3 Drug Types
should be entered in Drug Type 3.
Data Element 21 (Estimated Drug Quantity)
LEAs should use Data Element 21 to indicate the quantity of drugs or narcotics seized in a drug
case. Therefore, LEAs should use it only if one of the offenses in the incident was
35A = Drug/Narcotic Violations, 6 = Seized was entered into Data Element 14 (Type Property
Loss/ Etc.), and 10 = Drugs/Narcotics was entered into Data Element 15 (Property Description).
The NIBRS Technical Specification indicates nine characters are available to enter the number of
whole pounds, ounces, grams, etc., and three more characters are available to enter the
decimal amount (i.e., the quantity expressed in thousandths). Because the decimal is implied,
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 137
agencies should not enter a decimal point into Data Element 21. LEAs should enter trace
amounts of a drug as “000000000001” in this data element.
If the substance was sent to a laboratory for analysis, and a response has not yet been received,
then agencies must enter 1 = None (i.e., 000000001000) into Data Element 21 to indicate None.
LEAs must update this interim report with the true quantity once the response arrives.
LEAs may enter up to three quantities to match the up-to-three drug types reported in Data
Element 20 (Suspected Drug Type). If more than three drugs or narcotics are involved, the
quantities of the two most important (as determined by the reporting agency taking into
account their quantity, value, and deadliness) should be entered. Agencies should not enter the
quantity of the remaining drugs/narcotics coded as X = Over 3 Drug Types. Agencies should
leave this data element blank.
Because of problems in determining the street value of drugs or narcotics, agencies should not
report a monetary value when they seize the drugs or narcotics in connection with drug or
narcotic violations. However, in order to obtain some measure of the drug problem, agencies
should report the Estimated Quantity of seized drugs or narcotics for each Drug/Narcotic
Violation in these instances.
LEAs should not use this data element when they find drugs or narcotics, connected with other
offenses, e.g., Arson, Burglary/Breaking and Entering, Larceny-Theft.
Example 1
An agency seizes 1.5 kilograms of Crack, 2.125 pounds of Marijuana, 2.0 liquid ounces of
Morphine, and 500 Valium capsules. The agency should enter 000000001500 for the Crack and
000000002125 for the Marijuana into Data Element 21. The agency should not enter quantities
for the Morphine or Valium.
Example 2
LE seized 15 marijuana plants from a greenhouse inside a residence. Police also seized 5 pounds
of Marijuana. The agency should enter 000000015000 for the plants and for the 000000005000
for the Marijuana. (Remember the last three digits of the field represent the tenths,
hundredths, and thousandths to the right of an implied decimal.)
Example 3
An LEA seized a bag of white powder that they suspected was drugs. They sent the powder to
the laboratory for analysis. Therefore, the agency would enter 000000001000 = None into Data
Element 21. In addition, the agency must update the information once the analysis is complete.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 138
Data Element 22 (Type Drug Measurement)
LEAs should use Data Element 22 to indicate the type of measurement used in quantifying
drugs or narcotics seized in a drug case. Therefore, it should be used only if one of the offenses
in an incident was 35A = Drug/Narcotic Violations, 6 = Seized was entered into Data Element 14
(Type Property Loss/Etc.), and 10 = Drugs/Narcotics was entered into Data Element 15
(Property Description).
Data Element 22 (Type Drug Measurement) can contain up to three entries, and the data values
should be consistent with the data values reported for Data Element 20 (Suspected Drug Type).
If more than three are involved, the types of measurement of the two most important drugs or
narcotics (as determined by the reporting agency taking into account their quantity, value, and
deadliness) should be entered. Do not enter the type of measurement for the remaining drugs
or narcotics that are coded as X = Over 3 Drug Types in Data Element 20 (Suspected Drug Type);
leave this data element blank.
If the substance was sent to a laboratory for analysis and a response has not yet been received,
XX = Not Reported should be entered. In addition, 1 = None should be entered into Data
Element 21 (Estimated Drug Quantity). When the agency receives the results of the laboratory
analysis, the agency must update Data Elements 21 (Estimated Drug Quantity) and 22 (Type
Drug Measurement).
LEAs should not use this data element when they find drugs or narcotics, connected with other
offenses, e.g., Arson, Burglary/Breaking and Entering, Larceny/Theft.
Valid Data Values
LEAs may enter up to three of the following measurement types in Data Element 22 (Type Drug
Measurement):
Weight Capacity Units
GM = Gram ML = Milliliter DU = Dosage Units/Items1
KG = Kilogram LT = Liter NP = Number of Plants2
OZ = Ounce FO = Fluid Ounce
LB = Pound GL = Gallon
XX = Not Reported
1 Number of capsules, pills, tablets, etc.
2 e.g., Marijuana plants (bushes)
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 139
Note: When more than three types of drugs are involved, the type of measurement for the two
most important drugs (as determined by the reporting agency based on the quantity, value, and
deadliness of the drugs/narcotics) should be reported in Measurement Type 1 and
Measurement Type 2; Measurement Type 3 should be left blank.
Example 1
An agency seizes 1.5 kilograms of Crack, 2.125 pounds of Marijuana, 2.0 liquid ounces of
Morphine, and 500 Valium capsules. The agency should enter KG = Kilogram for the Crack and
LB = Pound for the Marijuana. The agency should make no entries for the Morphine or Valium.
Example 2
LE seized 15 marijuana plants from a greenhouse inside a residence. Police also seized 5 pounds
of Marijuana. The agency should enter NP = Number of Plants for the plants and LB = Pound for
the Marijuana.
Example 3
An LEA seized a bag of white powder, suspected to be drugs. They sent the powder to the
laboratory for analysis. The agency should enter U = Unknown for Suspected Drug Type and
XX = Type Drug Measurement pending laboratory results.
Data Element 23 (Victim Sequence Number)
Victim Sequence Number is used to assign each victim in an incident a sequence number from
001 to 999. LEAs should then submit separate victim information for each numbered victim.
Example
If there were three victims in an incident, the LEA should report victim information for each of
the three victims—one with Victim Sequence Number 001, another with 002, and the last with
003.
Some assault situations can pose difficulties in distinguishing victims. If multiple persons are
involved in a dispute or disturbance and LE investigations cannot establish the aggressors from
the victims, record all persons involved as both victims and offenders. (Such situations can
occur with domestic disputes, barroom brawls, etc.)
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 140
Data Element 24 (Victim Connected to UCR Offense Code)
LEAs should use Data Element 24 to link each victim to the up to ten most serious (as
determined by the reporting agency) Group A offenses that were perpetrated against the victim
during the incident.
Example
An offender robbed two victims, Victim 001 and Victim 002 and also raped Victim 001. In the
victim information for Victim 001, the agency should report both 120 = Robbery and 11A =
Rape. In the victim information for Victim 002, the agency should submit only 120 = Robbery.
Note: Each offense may not affect every victim in an incident. For each victim, report only those
offenses affecting the victim.
Note: The robbery/assault example above contains “lesser included” offenses. Mutually
exclusive offenses are offenses that cannot occur to the same victim according to UCR
Definitions. Lesser included offenses are offenses where one offense is an element of another
offense and cannot be reported as having happened to the victim along with the other offense.
(For more information about mutually exclusive/lesser included offenses, refer to the NIBRS
Technical Specification, Data Element 24 [Victim Connected to UCR Offense Code]).
Data Element 25 (Type of Victim)
LEAs should use Data Element 25 to categorize each victim associated with a NIBRS incident.
Valid Data Values
LEAs should enter only one per victim segment:
B = Business
F = Financial Institution
G = Government
I = Individual
L = Law Enforcement Officer (valid for offenses 09A, 13A, 13B, and 13C only)
O = Other
R = Religious Organization
S = Society/Public
U = Unknown
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 141
Example
During a bank robbery, the offender pointed a gun at a teller and demanded and received
money. The robber also pistol-whipped a customer who stood in his way as he made his
getaway from the bank. There were three victims: the bank (F = Financial Institution), the teller
(I = Individual), and the pistol-whipped customer (I = Individual). Therefore, agencies should
enter the appropriate codes into their respective Victim Segments.
Note: When the type of victim is L = Law Enforcement Officer, agencies must report Data
Elements 25A, 25B, and, if applicable, 25C. Agencies should report only the victim type of L =
Law Enforcement Officer when an officer is the victim of a murder/nonnegligent manslaughter
or an assault. For other types of crimes (such as Robbery), the victim type should be I =
Individual.
Data Elements 25A – 25C Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA)
LEAs should use Data Elements 25A, 25B, and 25C to report line-of-duty felonious killings and
assaults on sworn LEOs, who have full arrest powers. LEAs should report all assaults on officers,
with or without injuries.
LEAs should also consider entering the offender into the NCIC Violent Person File (VPF). The
NCIC VPF contains information on individuals who have the propensity of violence towards LE.
Entering the individual into the NCIC VPF immediately alerts LEOs of the individual’s history of
violence towards LE when they query NCIC during future encounters with that individual.. For
additional information on the NCIC VPF, contact the NCIC Investigative and Operation
Assistance Group at ioau@fbi.gov.
Note: In April 2015, LEOKA included special role functions in its definition: “An individual
serving in the capacity of a LEO at the request of a LEA whose officers meet the current
collection criteria. The individual must be under the supervision of a certified LEO from the
requesting agency at the time of the incident but is not required to be in the physical presence
of the officer while he or she is working an assigned duty.”
Data Element 25A (Type of Officer Activity/Circumstance)
Data Element 25A—Type of Officer Activity/Circumstance—describes the type of activity that
the officer was engaged at the time he or she was assaulted or killed in the line of duty.
Valid Data Values
LEAs should enter only one per victim segment:
01 = Responding to Disturbance Call (family quarrels, person with firearm, etc.)
02 = Burglaries in Progress or Pursuing Burglary Suspects
03 = Robberies in Progress or Pursuing Robbery Suspects
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 142
04 = Attempting Other Arrests
05 = Civil Disorder (riot, mass disobedience)
06 = Handling, Transporting, Custody of Prisoners
07 = Investigating Suspicious Persons or Circumstances08 = Ambush, No Warning
09 = Handling Persons with Mental Illness
10 = Traffic Pursuits and Stops
11 = All Other
Data Element 25B (Officer Assignment Type)
LEAs should use Data Element 25B—Officer Assignment Type—to specify the officer’s type of
assignment at the time he/she sustained injury or died while on duty. Code F (Two-Officer
Vehicle) and codes G and H (One-Officer Vehicle Alone and Assisted, respectively) pertain to
uniformed officers; codes I and J (Detective or Special Assignment Alone and Assisted,
respectively) to non-uniformed officers; and codes K and L (Other Alone and Assisted,
respectively) to officers assaulted or killed while in other capacities, such as foot patrol or off
duty.
Valid Data Values
LEAs should enter only one per victim segment:
For Uniformed Law Enforcement Officers:
F = Two-Officer Vehicle
G = One-Officer Vehicle (Alone)
H = One-Officer Vehicle (Assisted)
For Non-Uniformed Officers:
I = Detective or Special Assignment (Alone)
J = Detective or Special Assignment (Assisted)
For Law Enforcement Officers Serving in Other Capacities (Foot patrol, Off duty, etc.):
K = Other (Alone)
L = Other (Assisted)
Note: The term “assisted” refers to LE assistance only.
Example 1
An agency dispatched a one-officer vehicle to the scene of a crime in progress. There were no
other units to back up the officer. The perpetrator, who had committed a Burglary, immediately
fired on the officer upon his arrival at the scene. The agency should report the incident as G =
One-Officer (Alone).
Example 2
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 143
An agency dispatched a one-officer vehicle to the scene of a crime in progress. Another one-
officer vehicle answered the call as well. While attempting to apprehend the individual, the
perpetrator punched one of the officers. The agency should code the incident as
H = One-Officer (Assisted).
Data Element 25C (Officer – ORI Other Jurisdiction)
An ORI is the unique nine-character identifier that the NCIC has assigned to each agency. If a
perpetrator killed or assaulted a LEO who was on duty in a jurisdiction other than his/her own,
the LEA having jurisdiction where the incident occurred should report the LEO killed or
assaulted. The agency should use Data Element 25C to identify the ORI of the LEO’s agency. The
agency does not need to enter information in this data element if the officer is assaulted in
his/her own jurisdiction.
Example
On May 2, 2018, a perpetrator shot LEO. The officer was working in conjunction with a state
narcotics task force in a jurisdiction outside his own duty assignment while serving a warrant on
an individual known to be operating a methamphetamine lab. In reporting the incident, the
covering agency should use Data Element 25C (Officer – ORI Other Jurisdiction) because the
LEO was assaulted in the line of duty outside his regularly assigned jurisdiction.
Data Element 26 (Age of Victim)
Data Element 26—Age of Victim—indicates the age or age range of an individual (person) victim
in an incident when the crime occurred.
Valid Data Values
01 – 98 = Years Old
NN = Under 24 Hours
NB = 1 – 6 Days Old
BB = 7 – 364 Days Old
99 = Over 98 Years Old
00 = Unknown
Note: When the victim is a law enforcement officer, the only valid age range is 17-98.
Example 1
A 20-year-old female told police she was a victim of rape when she was 15 years old. The
correct reported age value for Data Element 26 is 15 = 15 Years Old.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 144
Example 2
If a deceased male victim appeared to be a teenager, agencies could report the Age of Victim as
13 to 19 (i.e., 1319).
Data Element 27 (Sex of Victim)
Data Element 27—Sex of Victim—indicates the sex of an individual (person) victim in an incident.
Valid Data Values
F = Female
M = Male
U = Unknown
Data Element 28 (Race of Victim)
Data Element 28—Race of Victim—indicates the race of an individual (person) victim in an
incident.
Valid Data Values
W = White
B = Black or African American
I = American Indian or Alaska Native
A = Asian

Kosraean, Melanesian, Micronesian, Northern Mariana Islander, Palauan, Papua New Guinean,
Ponapean (Pohnpelan), Polynesian, Solomon Islander, Tahitian, Tarawa Islander, Tokelauan,
Tongan, Trukese (Chuukese), and Yapese.
Note: The term “Native Hawaiian” does not include individuals who are native to the state of
Hawaii simply by virtue of being born there.
Data Element 29 (Ethnicity of Victim)
Data Element 29—Ethnicity of Victim—indicates the ethnicity of an individual (person) victim in
an incident. This is an optional data element.
Valid Data Values

U = Unknown
The ethnic designation of Hispanic or Latino includes persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban,
Central or South American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.
Data Element 30 (Resident Status of Victim)
If the victim type entered in Data Element 25 (Type of Victim) was I = Individual, LEAs should
enter the person’s resident status (resident or nonresident) into Data Element 30 (Resident
Status of Victim). This is an optional data element.
Note: Resident status does not refer to the immigration or national citizenship status of the
individual. Instead, it identifies whether individuals are residents or nonresidents of the
jurisdiction that the incident occurred. It also enables agencies having a high transient
population to show their population at risk is higher than their official resident population.
A resident is a person who maintains his or her permanent home for legal purposes in the
locality (town, city, or community) where the crime took place. Reporting agencies should base
their determinations of residency on the town, city, or community where the crime occurred
rather than their broader geographical jurisdictions. For university/college campuses, only
persons living on campus (in dormitories, etc.) would be considered residents if victimized
within the confines of the school property; a campus LEA should report the crime.
Valid Data Values
N = Nonresident
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 146
R = Resident
U = Unknown
Example 1
A victim was robbed in San Diego, California, where he resides; the agency should enter
R = Resident.
Example 2
The victim of a crime was a business. Because the victim was not an individual, the agency
should not use this data element.
Data Element 31 (Aggravated Assault/Homicide Circumstances)
Data Element 31 describes the circumstances of either an Aggravated Assault or a Homicide.
Therefore, LEAs should use it only with offenses of 13A = Aggravated Assault and
09A-09C = Homicide Offenses.
LEAs should base selections of circumstances on information known following their
investigation, not decisions of a grand jury, coroner’s inquest, or other agency outside LE. LEAs
should always select the most appropriate circumstances as determined by investigation.
Traffic fatalities associated with driving under the influence, distracted driving (using a
cell/smartphone, and reckless driving traffic fatalities are included as negligent manslaughters.
Accidental traffic fatalities, accidental deaths (not resulting from gross negligence), or deaths of
persons due to their own negligence are not to be included as Negligent Manslaughters. LEAs
should report information regarding all other Negligent Manslaughters regardless of actions to
prosecute.
Note: Data Value 06 now represents “Domestic Violence” data (see the definition of “Domestic
and Family Violence”)
Valid Data Values for 13A = Aggravated Assault and 09A = Murder and Nonnegligent
Manslaughter
LEAs may enter up to two circumstances per victim segment:

30 = Child Playing With Weapon
31 = Gun-Cleaning Accident
32 = Hunting Accident
33 = Other Negligent Weapon Handling
34 = Other Negligent Killing
Note: Values 30-33 are reserved for the use of a firearm. The data value 34 = Other Negligent
Killing should be used when Negligent Manslaughter offenses are reported due to the offender
driving under the influence, driving distracted while using a cell/smartphone, or driving
recklessly.
Valid Data Values for 09C = Justifiable Homicide
LEAs can enter one circumstance per victim segment:
20 = Criminal Killed by Private Citizen
21 = Criminal Killed by Police Officer
06 Domestic and Family Violence
The use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force or a weapon; or the use of coercion
or intimidation; or committing a Crime Against Property by a current or former spouse, parent,
or guardian of the victim; a person with whom the victim shares a child in common; a person
who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim; a
person who is cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse, parent, or
guardian; or by a person who is or has been similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian
of the victim.

killed a member of the other gang. Possible entries are 01 = Argument, 03 = Drug Dealing, and
05 = Juvenile Gang. Even though all three would apply, there is a limit of two entries. Since the
agency should report the two most descriptive data values, it should report 03 = Drug Dealing
and 05 = Juvenile Gang.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 148
Example 2
While resisting an arrest, a fugitive brandished a gun and fired twice in the direction of two
police officers who were attempting to take the fugitive into custody. Neither officer sustained
injury, but both drew their weapons and returned fire, killing the fugitive. Because this was a
justifiable homicide, the agency should enter 21 = Criminal Killed by Police Officer.
Example 3
A police officer responded to a night time disturbance call at a single family residence. Upon
arriving at the scene, the officer knocked on the door. The door was answered by a man and a
woman. Over the course of several minutes of questioning, the officer learned the woman was
the renter of the home and the man was her ex-boyfriend. They had been arguing because the
ex-boyfriend wanted to take the victims laptop. When the victim said no, the ex-boyfriend
began throwing several objects around the house and ultimately struck the woman with a table
lamp, causing severe lacerations. Because this incident was domestic related and the offense
was aggravated assault, the agency should enter 06 = Domestic Violence.
Example 4
A police officer responded to a report of gunshots at a convenience store. Upon arrival, the
officer found a crowd in front of the convenience store. He then entered the store to find a
male gunshot victim and the store clerk. The clerk reported the victim and a female entered the
store and had an argument that lasted several minutes. The female then shot the victim with a
handgun and fled the store. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene. The female was
apprehended several hours later and identified as the victim’s wife. Because this incident is
domestic related and the offense was murder, the agency should enter 06 = Domestic Violence.
Data Element 32 (Additional Justifiable Homicide Circumstances)
Data Element 32—Additional Justifiable Homicide Circumstances—further describes the
circumstances of a Justifiable Homicide, i.e., when an agency enters either 20 = Criminal Killed
by Private Citizen or 21 = Criminal Killed by Police Officer into Data Element 31.
Valid Data Values
LEAs should enter one circumstance per victim segment:
A = Criminal Attacked Police Officer and That Officer Killed Criminal
B = Criminal Attacked Police Officer and Criminal Killed by Another Police Officer
C = Criminal Attacked a Civilian
D = Criminal Attempted Flight From a Crime
E = Criminal Killed in Commission of a Crime
F = Criminal Resisted Arrest
G = Unable to Determine/Not Enough Information
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 149
Example
In the scenario given above in Example 2, while resisting an arrest, a fugitive brandished a gun
and fired twice in the direction of two police officers who were attempting to take him into
custody. Neither officer sustained injury, but both drew their weapons and returned fire, killing
the fugitive. This was a justifiable homicide; the LEA should report the incident as 21 = Criminal
Killed by Police Officer. Since the agency can report only one data value for the Additional
Justifiable Homicide Circumstance, it should submit the most descriptive data value. In this
case, the reporting agency should enter A = Criminal Attacked Police Officer and That Officer
Killed Criminal.
Data Element 33 (Type Injury)
When Data Element 25 (Type of Victim) is I = Individual and Data Element 6 (UCR Offense Code)
is one or more of the following offenses, LEAs should use Data Element 33 (Type Injury) to

Apparent Broken Bones and L = Severe Laceration.
Example 2
Because the victim was a respected religious figure, the offender blackmailed the victim
regarding his sexual activities. Since he suffered no physical injury, the entry should be N =
None.
Data Element 34 (Offender Number to be Related)
LEAs should use Offender Number to be Related to enter the Offender Sequence Number
(found in Data Element 36) of each offender to be identified in Data Element 35 (Relationship of
Victim to Offender). Enter 00 = Unknown when Data Element 36 (Offender Sequence Number)
is 00 = Unknown Offender. When more than ten offenders are identified, LEAs should enter the
ten most closely related to the victim. This data element is mandatory when one of the offenses

The agency should use Data Element 35—Relationship of Victim to Offender—along with Data
Element 34 (Offender Number to be Related), to report the relationship of the victim to the
offender(s) who perpetrated a Crime Against Person or a Crime Against Property.
When the LEA identifies more than ten offenders, the LEA should enter the ten most closely
related to the victim. This data element is mandatory when one of the offenses entered into
Data Element 24 (Victim Connected to UCR Offense Code) is a Crime Against Person or a Crime
Against Property (in the case of Robbery), when Data Element 25 (Type of Victim) is I =

Valid Data Values
LEA should enter only one per arrestee:
O = On-View Arrest (apprehension without a warrant or previous incident report)
S = Summoned/Cited (not taken into custody)
T = Taken Into Custody (based on a warrant and/or previously submitted incident report)
Example 1
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 158
An LEA without a warrant arrested a woman who was soliciting for prostitution on a street
corner. The agency should enter O = On-View Arrest.
Example 2
An officer served a man with a subpoena summoning him to appear in court. The agency should
enter S = Summoned/Cited.
Example 3
A citizen filed a complaint. The LEA then investigated the incident and, based on a warrant, took
the offender into custody. The LEA should report T = Taken Into Custody for Type of Arrest.
Data Element 44 (Multiple Arrestee Segments Indicator)
The Multiple Arrestee Segments Indicator (Data Element 44) ensures that an LEA counts the
arrestee only once when the arrest is related to multiple incidents.
The reporting agency should enter C = Count Arrestee for one incident in the Multiple Arrestee
Segments Indicator and M = Multiple in this data element for all of the remaining incidents. If a
suspect’s arrest did not clear additional incidents, the entry should be N = Not Applicable.
Valid Data Values
LEAs should enter only one per arrestee per incident:
C = Count Arrestee
M = Multiple
N = Not Applicable
Example
After an LEA apprehended a robbery suspect, the LEA learned that the suspect was also
responsible for five additional robberies within the jurisdiction. The agency should enter
C = Count Arrestee for the robbery using the Multiple Arrestee Segments Indicator and
M = Multiple in this data element for all of the remaining robberies.
Data Element 45 (UCR Arrest Offense Code)
The UCR Arrest Offense Code (Data Element 45) identifies the offense for which the LEA
arrested an offender. An LEA can arrest an offender for any of the Group A or Group B offenses
except 09C = Justifiable Homicide. If a LEA apprehends an arrestee for more than one offense,
the reporting agency must determine the most serious offense and enter it as the arrest
offense.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 159
An agency can report a Group B offense for Group A Incident Reports, as long as the reporting
agency determined that the Group B offense was the most serious arrest offense. Any arrest
(regardless of arrest offense reported) made in connection with a Group A incident will result in
its clearance.
Example 1
If a LEA arrests an offender for both robbery and murder, they should report
09A = Murder and Nonnegligent Manslaughter, the more serious offense.
Example 2
A LEA arrests an offender for DUI, a Group B offense. They subsequently determined the
arrestee had been involved in a previously reported Robbery. The LEA should report the arrest
offense for the robbery as 90D = Driving Under the Influence. The agency would not have to
submit a Group B Arrest Report.
Data Element 46 (Arrestee Was Armed With)
An agency should use Data Element 46 to indicate whether they arrested an offender in
possession of a commonly known weapon at the time of his or her arrest.
Valid Data Values
LEAs may enter up to two:
01 = Unarmed
11 = Firearm (type not stated)
12 = Handgun
13 = Rifle
14 = Shotgun
15 = Other Firearm
16 = Lethal Cutting Instrument (e.g., switchblade knife or martial arts stars)
17 = Club/Blackjack/Brass Knuckles
Note: The FBI defines an automatic firearm as any firearm that shoots, or is designed to shoot,
more than one shot at a time by a single pull of the trigger without manual reloading. If the
weapon was an automatic firearm, an A should be reported in the Automatic Weapon
Indicator, e.g., 13A = Automatic Rifle. Do not include semi-automatic as an automatic weapon.
Example 1
When an LEA arrested a man, he had in his possession a .357-caliber revolver and a penknife.
The entry should be 12 = Handgun. Because LE does not generally consider a small pocket knife
to be a weapon (unless used in that manner), the LEA should not report it.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 160
Example 2
An LEA arrested a female who resisted the arrest using a liquor bottle and a chair as weapons
before being subdued. The entry should be 01 = Unarmed. Although the subject used items as
weapons, the FBI does not consider the weapons used in this incident as weapons that are
commonly in possession of.
Data Element 47 (Age of Arrestee)
Data Element 47—Age of Arrestee—indicates the age or age range of an arrestee in an incident.
Valid Data Values
01 – 98 = Years Old
99 = Over 98 Years Old
00 = Unknown
Example 1
The arrestee refused to give his date of birth at time of arrest, but he appeared to be between
35 and 40 years old. The LEA can report either 00 = Unknown or 3540 (i.e., 35 to 40 years old).
Data Element 48 (Sex of Arrestee)
Data Element 48—Sex of Arrestee—indicates the sex of an arrestee in an incident.
Valid Data Values
F = Female
M = Male
U = Unknown
Data Element 49 (Race of Arrestee)
Data Element 49—Race of Arrestee—indicates the race of an arrestee in an incident.
Valid Data Values
W = White
B = Black or African American
I = American Indian or Alaska Native
A = Asian
P = Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
U = Unknown
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 161
The definitions of the racial designations are:
White—A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or
North Africa.
Black or African American—A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa.
American Indian or Alaska Native—A person having origins in any of the original peoples of
North and South America (including Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation or
community attachment.
Asian—A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the
Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia,
Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander—A person having origins in any of the original peoples
of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands, e.g., individuals who are Carolinian, Fijian,
Kosraean, Melanesian, Micronesian, Northern Mariana Islander, Palauan, Papua New Guinean,
Ponapean (Pohnpelan), Polynesian, Solomon Islander, Tahitian, Tarawa Islander, Tokelauan,
Tongan, Trukese (Chuukese), and Yapese.
Note: The term “Native Hawaiian” does not include individuals who are native to the state of
Hawaii simply by virtue of being born there.
Data Element 50 (Ethnicity of Arrestee)
Data Element 50—Ethnicity of Arrestee—indicates the ethnicity of an arrestee in an incident.
This is an optional data element.
Valid Data Values
H = Hispanic or Latino
N = Not Hispanic or Latino
U = Unknown
The ethnic designation of Hispanic or Latino includes persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban,
Central or South American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 162
Data Element 51 (Resident Status of Arrestee)
LEAs should use Data Element 51—Resident Status of Arrestee—to indicate whether the
arrestee was a resident or nonresident of the jurisdiction that the incident occurred. This is an
optional data element.
Valid Data Values
N = Nonresident
R = Resident
U = Unknown
Note: Resident Status does not refer to the immigration or national citizenship status of the
individual. Instead, it identifies whether individuals are residents or nonresidents of the
jurisdiction in which the incident occurred. It also enables agencies having a high transient
population to show their population at risk is higher than their official resident population.
A resident is a person who maintains his or her permanent home for legal purposes in the
locality (town, city, or community) where the crime took place. Reporting agencies should base
their determinations of residency on the town, city, or community where the crime occurred
rather than their broader geographical jurisdictions. For university/college campuses, only
persons living on campus (in dormitories, etc.) would be considered residents if victimized
within the confines of the school property; a campus LEA should report the crime.
Example 1
A man was arrested for a crime that occurred in Phoenix, Arizona, and the arrestee maintained
his legal residence in the city; therefore, the entry should be R = Resident.
Example 2
The crime occurred in Washington, D.C., but the arrestee maintained his legal residence in
Alexandria, Virginia. The entry should be N = Nonresident.
Data Element 52 (Disposition of Arrestee Under 18)
LEAs should use Data Element 52—Disposition of Arrestee Under 18—to report the nature of
an arrestee’s detention if the arrestee was 17 years of age or younger at the time of the arrest.
The word arrest as it applies to juveniles is intended to mean the LE handling of those juveniles
who have committed a crime and are taken into custody under such circumstances that, if the
juvenile were an adult, an arrest would have been reported.
Depending on the seriousness of the offense and the offender’s prior criminal record, this may
include a warning by the police with the juvenile being released to parents, relatives, friends, or
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 163
guardians. Or, LEAs may refer juveniles to the probation department or some other branch of
the juvenile court; to welfare agencies; to other LEAs; or, in the case of serious offenders, to
criminal or adult court by waiver of juvenile court. Therefore, LEAs should include not only
arrests in the usual sense, but an LEA should report any situation where they handle/process a
young person for a violation of the law, in lieu of an actual arrest (e.g., summons, citation, or
notification to appear before a juvenile or youth court or similar authority).
Agencies should not record incidents of police contacts with juveniles where no offense has
been committed (e.g., instructing children to move their ballgame from the street to the
playground) and instances where juveniles are taken into custody for their own protection (i.e.,
the juvenile’s welfare is endangered). In addition, LEAs should not report as arrests callbacks or
follow-up contacts with young offenders by officers for the purpose of determining their
progress, since the FBI intends these statistics to measure LE problems, not juvenile court
activity.
Valid Data Values
Regarding dispositions of individuals under age 18, LEAs should enter only one per arrestee:
H = Handled Within Department (released to parents, released with warning, etc.)
R = Referred to Other Authorities (turned over to juvenile court, probation department, welfare
agency, other police agency, criminal or adult court, etc.)
Juvenile Arrest Reporting
The FBI’s UCR Program does not collect the identities of individuals. Therefore, laws or
regulations pertaining to the confidential treatment of the identity of juvenile offenders do not
preclude the collection of arrest information for FBI’s UCR Program purposes or an agency’s
administrative use.
In a situation where juvenile records are not readily available because the LEA keeps them in a
juvenile bureau, youth bureau, or other special office, statistical compilation problems involving
juveniles can normally be resolved in one of the following ways:
1. The agency can route the arrest report (or copy) by juvenile or youth offices through the
main records operation so they can retrieve the necessary information.
2. The agency can route a statistical slip showing the required NIBRS information, but not the
name of the juvenile, to the employee who prepares NIBRS arrestee reports.
Example 1
An LEA arrested a 13-year-old for vandalizing a school and released the juvenile to his parents
with a warning. The entry should be H = Handled Within Department.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 164
Example 2
An LEA arrested a 17-year-old for murder and turned the juvenile over to the adult court for
trial as an adult. The entry should be R = Referred to Other Authorities.
5 Processes and Procedures
5.1 Implementation Procedures
This section addresses current management considerations at the agency (both UCR Program
and local LEA) and national levels for implementing conversion from the SRS to an incident-
based reporting (IBR) system. In the interim, submitting the SRS along with NIBRS data is
required until an agency is fully certified for NIBRS reporting. Following transition of the UCR
Program to a NIBRS-only data collection (that is, January 1, 2021), LEAs will no longer be
required to submit SRS data during the certification process.
General Information
When an agency has implemented an IBR system that meets the criteria established in the UCR
NIBRS IEPD or NIBRS Technical Specification, the agency’s next step is to begin submitting data
to the FBI's UCR Program. When an agency initially submits data to the FBI, the Crime and Law
Enforcement Statistics Unit evaluates the data based on the standards indicated in 5.2, NIBRS
Certification Process. The FBI considers all data from these NIBRS submissions as “test data” as
the data are not included in the official FBI UCR Program database until all processing problems
are resolved.
The agency must ensure that it has automated procedures (e.g., error handling, identifying
incidents it will submit) in place before testing with the FBI’s UCR Program. The testing phase
provides an opportunity for the participating agency to understand and experience NIBRS
submission process.
Agencies Converting from SRS to NIBRS
To resolve data processing issues, the agency may need to make several submissions to
complete the testing phase. During this time, the agency should continue to send SRS data until
the FBI certifies that the agency is a NIBRS data contributor. If this is not feasible, the agency
must make specific arrangements with the FBI to avoid data loss in SRS. Once the agency has
met each criterion of the NIBRS certification process, the FBI will provide a date when the
agency will begin to officially initiate NIBRS submissions. After that date, the agency will no
longer need to submit data via SRS.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 165
Duplicate Submission for Crime Incidents Must Be Prevented
When an agency is ready to submit data via NIBRS, they must ensure they do not submit NIBRS
data for crime data collected prior to converting to NIBRS (previously reported via SRS). For
example, if an agency begins NIBRS reporting in June, the agency must ensure they do not
report data for months before June via NIBRS.
The only updates to SRS data prior to an agency’s NIBRS conversion are exceptional clearances,
arrests, and recovered property. The FBI established guidelines regarding how to report
exceptional clearances, arrests, and recovered property in those instances when the agency
does not maintain the original incident report. With the official start of NIBRS reporting for an
agency, supplemental reporting will occur for previously submitted crime data in SRS.
Agency Must Begin Submitting NIBRS Data on the First Day of a Month
The UCR Program should ensure an agency begins NIBRS submissions only on the first day of a
given month; LEAs must not begin NIBRS submissions on any other day. This is the NIBRS
reporting start date. Use of this start date will eliminate both agency and FBI computer systems
needing to process both SRS and NIBRS data if an agency would implement NIBRS sometime
during a month (e.g., May 1-18 for the SRS and May 19-31 for NIBRS).
Monitoring the Certification Policy
The NIBRS coordinator administers the NIBRS certification policy. The NIBRS coordinator
communicates with an agency under review when the agency has attained certification or
when the agency needs to take additional steps to obtain certification.
The NIBRS coordinator tracks the status of states and agencies undergoing the NIBRS
certification process. Following certification, states and agencies must maintain the data quality
standards. The FBI’s UCR Program maintains the state and agency NIBRS certification records.
Note: The NIBRS coordinator serves as a cooperative liaison with personnel both internal and
external to the FBI for the purposes of managing NIBRS issues with the CJIS APB, ASUCRP, the
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), and federal law enforcement agencies. The NIBRS Coordinator
functions as an integral element of the NIBRS certification process, working closely with data
contributors and partner organizations to increase NIBRS participation and maintain data
quality following certification.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 166
5.2 NIBRS Certification Process
The FBI’s UCR Program deems a UCR Program or the LEA NIBRS Certified when the incident-
based data they submitted for NIBRS certification has passed the NIBRS certification criteria.
“NIBRS Certified” simply means the data submitted during the NIBRS certification process was
consistent with FBI’s UCR Program standards, and the FBI will accept NIBRS data submissions
from the state UCR Program or the LEA and will be included in the national database.
The UCR Program expects contributing agencies to satisfy the NIBRS certification criteria as
defined to become certified. In addition, LEAs must also demonstrate their ability to comply
with the four standards for state UCR Programs identified in Section 1.3, UCR Programs
Standards, in this manual. The UCR Program considers these standards essential for NIBRS
certification.
Until a UCR Program or LEA agency attains NIBRS-certified status, it is essential that they
continue to submit SRS data along with their NIBRS data submitted for certification.
NIBRS Certification Criteria
The FBI uses the following criteria to grant a UCR program or LEA NIBRS certification:
1. System Appropriateness
A UCR Program or LEA must provide evidence its NIBRS-reporting system is compatible
with FBI’s UCR Program system and follows NIBRS technical specifications. A state UCR
Program or LEA seeking NIBRS certification must submit its incident-based system’s
description including submission structure, crime categories, segment relationships,
number of offenses collected per incident, and data values allowed per data element.
The FBI will review this document for program design and concept.
2. Update Capability and Responsiveness
A UCR Program or LEA must demonstrate its ability to update submissions, meet
deadlines, respond to FBI queries and requests, and correct errors received from the
FBI’s UCR Program in a timely manner. A UCR Program or LEA must, at a minimum,
maintain a 2-year database of NIBRS submissions (retention period) and have the
capability to update incidents from the previous calendar year.
3. Error Rate
Data submissions must be logical and consistent. The FBI measures logic by the
percentage of Group A Incident Report submissions containing an error. The FBI defines
the error rate as the number of rejected reports over the number of reports submitted.
The FBI requires a sustained error rate of 4 percent or less for three separate data
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 167
submissions. The listing of error definitions are included in the NIBRS Technical
Specification.
4. Statistical Reasonableness
Data submissions must be statistically reasonable as a whole (in comparison to national
trends). While the error rate assesses the existence of logical mechanical flaws in the
data, it does not address data in the aggregate. The FBI’s UCR Program evaluates
aggregate data submissions in terms of percent distribution, data trend, volume, and
monthly fluctuations.
5.3 NIBRS Audit Program
The objective of the NIBRS audit program is to assess and ensure that each federal/state UCR
Program, and its local agencies, adheres to incident-based reporting methods consistent with
UCR standards set forth in the National Incident-Based Reporting System User Manual to
achieve uniform crime reporting nationwide.
The FBI’s UCR Program provides a nationwide view of crime based on the submission of crime
information by law enforcement agencies throughout the country. Accurate crime reporting is
essential to the credibility of the UCR Program. Designed to enhance the UCR Program, the
NIBRS audit is an assessment of a federal/state UCR Program and its compliance to the FBI’s
UCR Program standards and definitions.
The NIBRS audits are administered remotely via email, teleconference, and online information
sharing platforms by the CJIS Audit Unit (CAU) of the FBI’s CJIS Division, on a triennial cycle. The
CAU auditors collaborate with the UCR Program manager and CJIS Systems Officer (CSO) to
outline the scope of the audit, answers questions concerning the process, and establish the
relationship between the FBI and the federal/state UCR Program.
The NIBRS audit consists of three phases:
• Administrative Interview: The CAU auditor ascertains how the federal/state UCR
Program and/or local agency manages incidents and whether data submitted to the UCR
Program complies with the NIBRS User manual standards and definitions.
• Data Quality Review: The CAU auditor reviews officer case file documentation to include
the officer’s narrative and any information deemed supplemental to determine if the
agency appropriately applied standards and definitions. Any discrepancies are
documented and scored as the following:
Inaccurate - information reported does not match the case file.
o
Overreported - information reported was not documented in the case file.
o
Underreported - additional information is available in the case file and was not
o
reported.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 168
• Exit Briefing: The CAU auditor provides a briefing, which is a summarization of the audit
findings based on the administrative interview and the data quality review, to the
federal/state UCR Program manager, CSO, and/or local agency points of contact.
Note: If agencies and data are not available for an identified UCR Program, the CAU auditor will
conduct an “information only” NIBRS audit, which provides the UCR Program with an
opportunity to be introduced to the audit process and expectations for the next triennial audit
cycle.
Upon completion of the Exit Briefing, the CAU auditor will provide the audit results,
supplemental audit document, and policy/reference materials to the federal/state UCR
Program manager and CSO. The federal/state UCR Program manager and CSO are requested to
review and respond to the findings, if any, by indicating corrective actions that will be taken.
Upon receipt of that response, the CAU auditor finalizes the audit. The CAU auditor will provide
the final audit findings to the CJIS Advisory Policy Board pursuant to their respective shared
management responsibilities.
Training and Education
To ensure uniformity in the submission of data and further enhance the quality of the data the
FBI’s UCR Program releases, the FBI has trainers who provide instruction for LEAs participating
in the FBI’s UCR Program. The trainers furnish general training courses in procedures and
guidelines for data collections within the program. The trainers are available via e-mail
(ucrtraining@fbi.gov) to provide LEAs with answers to specific questions regarding
classification, as well as other questions about the FBI’s UCR Program.
The NIBRS coordinator supports agencies that contribute data via NIBRS. The NIBRS coordinator
assists agencies seeking NIBRS certification, works to increase NIBRS participation, and is
available to answer questions or address issues. For assistance with NIBRS, email UCR-
NIBRS@fbi.gov.
6 APPENDIX A – History of the FBI’s UCR Program and NIBRS
6.1 The FBI’s UCR Program
Recognizing a need for national crime statistics, the IACP formed the Committee on Uniform
Crime Records in the 1920s to develop a system of uniform crime statistics. In 1929, after
studying various facets of crime, assessing state criminal codes, and evaluating recordkeeping
practices, the Committee completed a plan for crime reporting that became the foundation of
the FBI’s UCR Program. The plan included standardized offense definitions for seven main
classifications of crime to gauge fluctuations in the overall volume and rate of crime. The seven
classifications were the violent crimes of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape,
robbery, and aggravated assault and the property crimes of burglary, larceny/theft, and motor
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 169
vehicle theft. By congressional mandate, the UCR Program added arson as the eighth major
offense in 1979.
In January 1930, 400 cities representing 20 million inhabitants in 43 states began participating
in the FBI’s UCR Program. The same year, the IACP was instrumental in gaining congressional
approval that authorized the FBI to serve as the national clearinghouse for statistical
information on crime. Since then, the nation’s LEAs have provided the FBI’s UCR Program with
data based on uniform classifications and procedures for reporting.
6.2 Redesign of UCR
Although the FBI’s UCR Program remained virtually unchanged throughout the years in terms of
the data collected and disseminated, by the 1980s a broad utility had evolved for UCR
information. Recognizing the need for improved statistics, LE called for a thorough evaluative
study to modernize the UCR Program. The FBI concurred with the need for an updated program
and lent its complete support, formulating a comprehensive three-phase redesign effort. The
BJS, the Department of Justice agency responsible for funding criminal justice information
projects, agreed to underwrite the first two phases. These phases, which would be conducted
by an independent contractor, Abt Associates Inc. of Cambridge, Massachusetts, would
determine what, if any, changes should be made to the current program. The third phase would
involve implementation of the changes identified.
In 1982, contractors began phase I by examining the historical evolution of the FBI’s UCR
Program. The study included all aspects of the program—the objectives and intended user
audience, data issues, reporting mechanisms, quality control issues, publications and user
services, and relationships with other criminal justice data systems. In 1984, contractors
launched phase II of the redesign effort by examining the potential of UCR and its future role.
Throughout phase I and phase II, stakeholders reviewed study findings, discussed the
contractor’s suggestions, and proposed various revisions to the contractor’s report. These
stakeholders included the FBI, the BJS, a joint committee on UCR with members from the IACP
and the NSA, a steering committee comprised of individuals representing various disciplines,
and attendees from two national UCR Conferences.
The group released a final report, the Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting
Program (Blueprint), in May 1985. It specifically outlined three recommended areas of
enhancement to expand and improve the FBI’s UCR Program to meet future informational
needs. First, agencies would use an incident-based system to report offenses and arrests.
Second, the FBI’s UCR Program would collect data on two levels, and third, the FBI’s UCR
Program would introduce a quality assurance program.
In January 1986, the FBI began phase III of the redesign effort guided by the general
recommendations set forth in the Blueprint. The FBI awarded a contract to develop new
offense definitions and data elements (incident details) and to develop the guidelines and
design specifications for implementing the new incident-based system. Though the FBI UCR
Program oversaw the direction of the project, the FBI collaborated with the ASUCRP, the IACP,
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 170
the National Alliance of State Drug Enforcement Agencies, the Drug Enforcement
Administration, and various federal, state, and local criminal justice agencies.
Concurrent with preparing the data elements, the FBI studied various state systems to select an
experimental site for implementing the redesigned program. Chosen for its long-standing
incident-based UCR Program and its willingness to adapt it to the FBI’s UCR Program
specifications, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) enlisted the cooperation of
nine local LEAs, representing in relative terms the small, medium, and large departments in
South Carolina, to participate in the project. To assist SLED with the pilot project, FBI personnel
developed automated data capture specifications to adapt the SLED’s state system to the FBI’s
UCR Program standards, and the BJS funded the revisions. The pilot demonstration ran from
March 1, 1987, until September 30, 1987, and resulted in further refinement of the guidelines
and specifications.
The FBI held a national UCR Conference on March 1-3, 1988, in Orange Beach, Alabama, to
present the new system to LE and obtain feedback on its acceptability. Attendees of the
national UCR Conference passed three overall recommendations without dissent: first, a new
incident-based national crime reporting system be established; second, the FBI manage this
program; and third, an APB composed of LE executives be formed to assist in directing and
implementing the new program. Furthermore, attendees recommended the implementation of
national incident-based reporting proceed at a pace commensurate with the resources and
limitations of contributing LEAs.
6.3 Establishing and Developing NIBRS
From March 1988 through January 1989, the FBI proceeded in developing and assuming
management of the new UCR system, and by April 1989, the FBI’s UCR Program received the
first test tape of NIBRS data. Over the course of the next few years, the FBI’s UCR Program
published information about the redesigned program in five documents:
1. Data Collection Guidelines—A system overview with descriptions of the offenses, offense
codes, reports, data elements, and data values.
2. Data Submission Specifications—Data layouts for use by state and local systems personnel
responsible for preparing magnetic media for submission to the FBI.
3. Approaches to Implementing an Incident-Based System—A guide for system designers.
4. Error Message Manual—Designations of mandatory and optional data elements, data
element edits, and error messages.
5. Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook, NIBRS Edition—A nontechnical program overview
focused on the definitions, policies, and procedures of NIBRS.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 171
These documents are no longer available, as they have been combined into this document and
the NIBRS Technical Specification.
As originally established, NIBRS used 52 data elements to collect a wide variety of crime data
via six types of data segments: administrative, offense, victim, property, offender, and arrestee.
The use of the segments and their respective data values (codes assigned for permitted entries)
depended upon whether the offender’s crime fit into the Group A or
Group B offense categories.
To provide state and local agencies with a stable system to implement, the FBI made the
commitment in the late 1980s to hold all recommended system changes to NIBRS in abeyance
until a substantial amount of contributors implemented the system. Agreement was reached
not to make several changes so LEAs could implement a program that was not continuously
changing. However, to meet crime’s growing challenges, lawmakers required the following
modifications to NIBRS:
• Hate Crime Statistics Data—Following Congress’ passage of the Hate Crime Statistics Act of
1990, the FBI added a new data element to NIBRS to indicate whether or not the offense
being reported was motivated by a bias against race, religion, ethnicity/national origin, or
sexual orientation, and, if so, what kind. The Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act of
1994 amended the Hate Crime Statistics Act to include bias against persons with disabilities.
The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crime Prevention Act mandated the
collection of bias-motivated gender and gender identity information, and crimes committed
by and against juveniles. In addition, the FBI’s UCR Program now collects up to five bias
motivations per offense type. The FBI’s UCR Program began accepting this data on January
1, 2013. On June 5, 2013, the CJIS APB approved a motion to modify the UCR Program’s
Hate Crime data collection procedures to begin collecting seven new religions (anti-
Buddhist, anti-Eastern Orthodox, anti-Hindu, anti-Jehovah’s Witness, anti-Church of Jesus
Christ, anti-Other Christian, and anti-Sikh), as well as an anti-Arab bias motivation. The
collection of these new categories began on January 1, 2015.
• Gang Activity Indicator—In response to another Congressional mandate in 1997, the FBI
expanded an existing data element to indicate whether or not the type of criminal activity
being reported was associated with gang violence. The added data values allowed for
juvenile gang entries as well as general gang associations.
• Cargo Theft Indicator—The USA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005
mandated the FBI to collect cargo theft data, and the FBI began accepting test data on

• Human Trafficking—The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization
Act of 2008 (TVPRA, 28 U.S.C. § 534) signed into law on December 23, 2008, reauthorized
the Trafficking Victims’ Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA, 22 U.S.C. § 7102) and required the
FBI’s UCR Program to collect and classify the crime of Human Trafficking as a Part I (SRS) and
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 172
Group A (NIBRS) offense in UCR, establish subcategories for state sex crimes, and
distinguish between incidents of assisting or promoting prostitution, purchasing
prostitution, and prostitution. The FBI’s UCR Program began accepting this data on January
1, 2013.
To meet the data needs of LE for officer safety and evolving crime challenges, the flexibility of
NIBRS has permitted LE to incorporate additional modifications.
• Data for Officers Killed or Assaulted—Under the direction of an advisory committee, the FBI
began collecting LEOKA data via NIBRS through three new data elements and a series of
new data codes in January 2003. The new data elements indicate the victim officer’s type of
activity/circumstance, the type of assignment, and the ORI of the LEO’s agency if the
offender killed or assaulted the victim officer in a jurisdiction other than his own.
• Removal of Runaway Category—In December 2008, the CJIS APB approved the elimination
of the arrest category Runaway from the FBI’s UCR Program. The FBI’s UCR Program no
longer accepts submissions of 90I = Runaway.
• Additional Location and Property Codes—As of January 1, 2010, the FBI began accepting
additional data values for the location and property data elements. At the request of the
ASUCRP, and with the group’s assistance, the FBI’s UCR Program expanded the location and
property codes to better capture the location of crimes and the property involved.
• Changes to the Definition of Rape and Other Related Sex Offenses—At the fall 2011 CJIS
APB meeting, the APB recommended, and then FBI Director Robert S. Mueller, III, approved,
changing the definition of rape in the FBI’s UCR Program and removing the words “forcible”
and “against the person’s will” in the SRS, NIBRS, Hate Crime Statistics, and Cargo Theft data
collection. In addition to collecting data following the new definition, the APB
recommended that the FBI’s UCR Program continue to collect historical rape data. The FBI’s
UCR Program began accepting this data on January 1, 2013.
• Changes to the Race and Ethnicity Data Collected—To comply with the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) 1997 directive, Revision to the Standards for the
Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity, the FBI began collecting ethnicity data
and expanded the race categories in all FBI’s UCR Program data collections in 2013. The
ethnicity categories include Hispanic or Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino; the race
categories include American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American,
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White.
• Additional NIBRS Offenses and Location Code–On April 28, 2014 the Director of the FBI
approved the APB recommendations to add two additional fraud offenses of Identity Theft
and Hacking/Computer Invasion. The Fall 2014 APB approved the recommendation to add
Cyberspace as a location code. On September 9, 2014, The FBI Director approved the APB
recommendation to collect animal cruelty information and four additional data values on
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 173
the specific type of abuse to include simple/gross neglect, intentional abuse and torture,
organized abuse, and animal sexual abuse.
• 11B Sodomy and 11C Sexual Assault with an Object may still be reported to the FBI’s UCR
Program and will be reclassified and recoded under the broader category of 11A = Rape.
Moving forward, all FBI UCR Program publications will reflect these offenses under the 11A
Rape category.
7 APPENDIX B – Benefits of NIBRS Participation
NIBRS is an indispensable tool in the war against crime because it is capable of producing
detailed, accurate, and meaningful data. When used to its full potential, NIBRS identifies with
precision when and where crime takes place, what form it takes, and the characteristics of its
victims and perpetrators. Armed with such information, LE can better define the resources it
needs to fight crime, as well as use those resources in the most efficient and effective manner.
Although most of the general concepts for collecting, scoring, and reporting UCR data in the SRS
apply in NIBRS, such as jurisdictional rules, there are some important differences in the two
systems. The most notable differences that give NIBRS an advantage over SRS are:
• No Hierarchy Rule—In the SRS, the Hierarchy Rule requires LEAs to report only the most
serious offense per incident; therefore, they do not report lower-listed offenses in multiple-
offense incidents. In NIBRS, LEAs report every offense occurring during an incident provided
the offenses are separate and distinct crimes, not just as part of another offense, i.e., a
“mutually exclusive” crime. (For more information about mutually exclusive offenses, refer
to the NIBRS Technical Specification, Data Element 24, Victim Connected to UCR Offense
Code.)
• Revised, Expanded, and New Offense Definitions—The FBI’s UCR Program revised several
SRS offense definitions for NIBRS-reporting purposes (e.g., the definition of assault to
include the offense of Intimidation, the definition of burglary to include self-storage units
with regard to the hotel rule). Furthermore, NIBRS defines and collects many specific sex
offenses, including such crimes as sodomy, sexual assault with an object, and Criminal
Sexual Contact, and sex offenses, including such crimes as statutory rape and incest. In the
SRS, these crimes are lumped under one category of Other Sex Offenses, a Part II arrest
offense.
• Using NIBRS, LE can report offense and arrest data for 28 Group A offense categories
(including 71 specific crimes) rather than the 10 Part I offenses in SRS. In addition, NIBRS
captures arrest data for 10 Group B offense categories (including 10 crimes), while the SRS
collected arrest data for 20 Part II crimes.
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 174
• Distinguishing between Attempted and Completed Group A Crimes—Except for the offenses
of rape and burglary, the SRS does not differentiate between attempted and completed
Part I crimes. NIBRS recognizes the difference between attempted and completed Group A
crimes.
• Greater Specificity in Reporting—Because SRS collects most of its crime data in the form of
categories (e.g., age groupings and property value groupings), it provides very little
capability to break down the resulting data into specific subcategories. However, because
NIBRS collects the details of crime incidents, it allows much greater specificity in reporting.
Some of those details include type of victim, residential status of victim and arrestee,
weapons data for several crimes, and the value of property stolen or recovered.
• Additional Scoring Category—In addition to the categories of Crimes Against Persons
(e.g., murder, rape, and aggravated assault) and Crimes Against Property (e.g., robbery,
burglary, and larceny/theft) in SRS, NIBRS offers the category of Crimes Against Society.
These crimes are not against persons because they do not actually involve an injured party;
nor are they against property because property is not the object of the crime. Program
developers created the category to represent society’s prohibitions on engaging in certain
types of activity, such as drug/narcotic offenses, gambling offenses, pornography/obscene
material, and prostitution offenses.
• Expanded Victim-to-Offender Relationship Data—In the SRS, LE reports the relationship of
the victim to the offender (e.g., the victim was the husband, wife, employer, or employee,
of the offender) only for homicides (i.e., Murder and Nonnegligent Manslaughter,
Manslaughter by Negligence, and Justifiable Homicide). In NIBRS, however, LE reports the
victim’s relationship to the offender(s) when the victim was the object of a Crime Against
Person, such as an assault offense, homicide offense, kidnapping/abduction, or sex offense.
Victim-to-offender relationship data are also reported for Robbery (Crimes Against
Property) because one of its elements is an assault, which makes it a violent crime.
• Expanded Circumstance Reporting—SRS and NIBRS both provide for collecting circumstance
data for homicides, but NIBRS also allows LE to report circumstance data for aggravated
assault. Furthermore, NIBRS permits the entry of up to two circumstance codes for each
murder or aggravated assault.
• Expanded Collection of Drug-Related Offenses—In the SRS, the subcategories of drug
violations are limited to sale/manufacturing and possession. However, in NIBRS, LEAs can
report the unlawful cultivation, manufacture, distribution, sale, purchase, use, possession,
transportation, or importation of any controlled drug or narcotic. Agencies can also report
the suspected drug type in one of the expanded drug-type categories. In the event of a drug
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 175
seizure, agencies can report the estimated quantity. NIBRS also allows agencies to report
the unlawful manufacture, sale, purchase, possession, or transportation of drug equipment
(paraphernalia).
In addition to capturing actual drug offenses, LEAs using NIBRS can report whether an LE
suspected offenders of various other offenses of having used drugs or narcotics during or
shortly before the commission of the crime(s).
• Capturing Computer Crime—To combat the growing problem of computer crime
(i.e., crimes directed at and perpetrated through the use of computers and related
equipment), NIBRS provides the capability to indicate whether a computer was the object of
the reported crime and to indicate whether the offenders used computer equipment to
perpetrate a crime.
• Association of Updated Reports—LEAs handle information updates, such as unfounding an
offense with subsequent submissions via the SRS, but there is no way to tie the update to
the original offense. In NIBRS, however, updated information is available with, and directly
tied to, the original incident.
• Identification of Common Problems or Trends—Aside from national data requirements,
many individual LEAs have very sophisticated records systems capable of producing a full
range of statistics on their own activities. Some local and state IBR systems include
additional data elements and data values to satisfy their local and state needs. As a
byproduct of all of those systems, NIBRS provides more common links among agencies. As
more LEAs use NIBRS, it will allow the identification of common crime problems or trends
among similar jurisdictions. Agencies can then work together to develop possible solutions
or proactive strategies for addressing the issues.
• More Useful Data—Once LEAs submit the preponderance of data via NIBRS, legislators,
municipal planners and administrators, academicians, penologists, sociologists, and the
general public will be better able to assess the nation’s crime problem. LE is a public service
and as such, requires a full accounting from the police commissioner, chief, sheriff, or
director as to the administration of the agency and the status of public safety within the
jurisdiction. By participating in NIBRS, agencies will have statistics to fulfill this
responsibility. NIBRS furnishes information on nearly every major criminal justice issue
facing LE today. The data are available from all levels of LE—federal, state, city,
university/college, county, and tribal—aggregated at the level and in the manner best
meeting the informational needs of the data user.
• The Effort to Collect Better Data— As the FBI’s UCR Program has been moving to modernize
over the last several years, recent events in our nation have magnified the need to collect
06/23/2025 2025.0 NIBRS User Manual 176
better and more informative data. To that end, the FBI has made getting those data a
priority for the FBI. The FBI’s UCR Program in coordination with major LE organizations and
federal partners including the BJS and the Office of Partner Engagement, have been working
diligently at all levels to improve the data collection for reliability, accuracy, accessibility,
and timeliness.
Rather than dividing its resources between two data collections, the FBI’s UCR Program
focused its efforts its efforts on NIBRS, which offers more detailed, robust data, as well as
the flexibility for LEAs to adapt their record management systems (RMSs) to the ever-
growing challenges of battling crime. That is why the FBI Director and the FBI’s UCR
Program staff have been reaching out to the CJIS APB and other LE organizations. With the
help of these advisory groups, the FBI’s UCR Program began its transition to a NIBRS-only
collection at the national level on January 1, 2021.
8 APPENDIX C – Time-Window Submissions
Time-Window Submissions are not required in the new UCR System. Since many LEAs will
continue to submit these data until their RMSs are updated, the FBI will continue to accept the
Time-Window Submissions. However, these submissions will simply replace the existing data
with the newer data that is submitted.
Refer to the NIBRS Technical Specification for more information on Time-Window Submissions.

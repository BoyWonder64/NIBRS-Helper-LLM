NIBRS Offense Codes
There are two categories of offenses reported in the NIBRS: Group A and Group B. It is
important to determine which category an offense belongs to because the reporting
requirements for Group A offenses and Group B offenses are different. Group A offenses are
used to report all incidents committed within a law enforcement agency’s jurisdiction to the
NIBRS, whereas Group B offenses are used only to report arrest data.
The following criteria were used to determine if a crime should be designated as a Group A
offense:
The seriousness or significance of the offense.
The frequency or volume of its occurrence.
The prevalence of the offense nationwide.
The probability of the offense being brought to law enforcement’s attention.
The likelihood that law enforcement is the best channel for collecting data regarding the
offense.
The burden placed on law enforcement to collect data on the offense.
The national statistical validity and usefulness of the collected data.
The FBI UCR Program’s responsibility to make crime data available not only to law
enforcement but to others having a legitimate interest in it.
There are 22 Group A offense categories making up 46 Group A offenses. The crime categories
are listed below in alphabetical order. Additionally, each offense’s corresponding UCR Offense
Code precedes its name. Immediately following the name of each offense name is an indication
of whether it involves a Crime Against Person, Crime Against Property, or Crime Against Society.
